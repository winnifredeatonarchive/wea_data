# Data Repository

This is the data repository for the Winnifred Eaton Archive project, which will contain all of the source data (primarily TEI files) and the associated schemas.

## Documentation

Our full documentation can be found within the [ODD File](sch/wea.odd). From the ODD file, we produce:

* A RelaxNG schema with embedded schematron
* An XSLT derived from the embedded schematron for validation
* Three versions of documentation:
   * [A full HTML version](docs/documentation_full.html), using the TEI's odd2html.xsl
   * [An abridged version for editorial use within oXygen](docs/oxygen_documentation.html)
   * [An abridged version for editorial use within Github](docs/github_documentation.md)
   
   
More documentation and more information forthcoming.
