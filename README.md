# Data Repository

This is the data repository for the Winnifred Eaton Archive project, which will contain all of the source data (primarily TEI files) and the associated schemas.

## Documentation

Our full documentation can be found within the [ODD File](sch/wea.odd). From the ODD file, we produce:

* A RelaxNG schema with embedded schematron
* An XSLT derived from the embedded schematron for validation
* Three versions of documentation:
   * A full HTML version, using the TEI's odd2html.xsl
   * An abridged version for editorial use, which is associated with a CSS stylesheet for viewing in oXygen's Author mode
   * The same as above, but in Github flavour markdown for use within Github.
   
More documentation and more information forthcoming.
