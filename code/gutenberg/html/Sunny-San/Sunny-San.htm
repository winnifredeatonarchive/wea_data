<p class="h2">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="indent">Madame Many Smiles was dead.
The famous dancer of the House of a
Thousand Joys had fluttered out into the
Land of Shadows. No longer would poet or
reveller vie with each other in doing homage
to her whose popularity had known no wane
with the years, who had, indeed, become one of
the classic objects of art of the city. In a land
where one's ancestry is esteemed the all important
thing, Madame Many Smiles had
stood alone, with neither living relatives nor ancestors
to claim her. Who she was, or whence
she had come, none knew, but the legend of the
House was that on a night of festival she had
appeared at the illuminated gates, as a moth,
who, beaten by the winds and storms without,
seeks shelter in the light and warmth of the
joyhouse within.</p>

<p class="indent">Hirata had bonded her for a life term. Her
remuneration was no more than the geishas'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
meagre wage, but she was allowed the prerogative
of privacy. Her professional duties over,
no admiring patron of the gardens might claim
her further service. She was free to return to
her child, whose cherry blossom skin and fair
hair proclaimed clearly the taint of her white
blood. Hirata was lenient in his training of
the child, for the dancer had brought with her
into the House of a Thousand Joys, Daikoku,
the God of Fortune, and Hirata could afford
to abide the time when the child of the dancer
should step into her shoes. But the day had
come far ahead of his preparations, and while
the dancer was at the zenith of her fame. They
were whispering about the gardens that the
moth that had fluttered against the House of
Joy had fluttered back into the darkness from
which she had come. With her she had taken
Daikoku.</p>

<p class="indent">A profound depression had settled upon the
House of a Thousand Joys. Geishas, apprentices
and attendants moved aimlessly about
their tasks, their smiles mechanical and their
motions automatic. The pulse and inspiration
of the house had vanished. In the gardens
the effect of the news was even more noticeable.
Guests were hurriedly departing, turning
their cups upside down and calling for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
their clogs. Tea girls slid in and out on hurried
service to the departing guests, and
despite the furious orders of the master to
affect a gaiety they did not feel, their best
efforts were unavailing to dispel the strange
veil of gloom that comes ever with death. The
star of the House of a Thousand Joys had
twinkled out forever.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the night of the festival of the Full
Moon. The cream of the city were gathered
to do honour to the shining Tsuki no Kami in
the clear sky above. But the death of the
dancer had cast its shadow upon all, and there
was a superstitious feeling abroad that it was
the omen of a bad year for the city.</p>

<p class="indent">In the emptying gardens, Hirata saw impending
ruin. Running hither and thither,
from house to garden, snapping his fingers,
with irritation and fury, he cursed the luck that
had befallen him on this night of all nights.
The maids shrank before his glance, or silently
scurried out of his path. The geishas with
automatic smile and quip vainly sought to
force a semblance of exhilaration, and the
twang of the samisen failed to drown that very
low beat of a Buddhist drum in the temple beyond
the gardens, where especial honour was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
to be paid to the famous dancer, who had given
her services gratuitously to the temple.</p>

<p class="indent">In fury and despair, Hirata turned from the
ingratiating women. Again he sought the
apartments where the dead dancer lay in state
among her robes. Here, with her face at her
mother's feet, the child of the dancer prayed
unceasingly to the gods that they would permit
her to attend her mother upon the long
journey to the Meido. Crushed and hurt by
a grief that nothing could assuage, only dimly
the girl sensed the words of the master, ordering
her half peremptorily, half imploringly
to prepare for service to the House. Possibly
it was his insinuation that for the sake of her
mother's honour it behooved her to step into
her place, and uphold the fame of the departed
one, that aroused her to a mechanical assent.
Soon she was in the hands of the dressers, her
mourning robes stripped, and the skin tights
of the trapese performer substituted.</p>

<p class="indent">Hirata, in the gardens, clapping his hands
loudly to attract the attention of the departing
guests, took his stand upon the little platform.
Saluting his patrons with lavish compliments,
he begged their indulgence and patience. The
light of his House, it was true, so he said, had
been temporarily extinguished, but the passing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
of a dancer meant no more than the falling of
a star; and just as there were other stars in
the firmament brighter than those that had
fallen, so the House of a Thousand Joys possessed
in reserve greater beauty and talent
than that the guests had generously bestowed
their favour upon. The successor to the honourable
dancer was bound to please, since she
excelled her mother in beauty even as the sun
does the moon. He therefore entreated his
guests to transfer their gracious patronage to
the humble descendant of Madame Many
Smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">The announcement caused as much of a sensation
as the news of the dancer's death had
done. There was an element of disapproval
and consternation in the glances exchanged in
the garden. Nevertheless there was a disposition,
governed by curiosity, to at least see the
daughter of the famous dancer, who appeared
on the night of her mother's death.</p>

<p class="indent">A party of American students, with a
tutor, were among those still remaining in
the gardens. Madame Many Smiles had been
an especial favourite with them, their interest
possibly due to the fact that she was said to
be a half caste. Her beauty and fragility had
appealed to them as something especially rare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
like a choice piece of cloisonn, and the romance
and mystery that seemed ever about
her, captivated their interest, and set them
speculating as to what was the true story of
this woman, whom the residents pointed to
with pride as the masterpiece of their city. An
interpreter having translated the words of the
manager, there was a general growl of disapproval
from the young Americans. However,
they, too, remained to see the daughter of
Madame Many Smiles, and pushed up near to
the rope, along which now came the descendant.</p>

<p class="indent">She was a child of possibly fourteen years,
her cheeks as vividly red as the poppies in her
hair, her long large eyes, with their shining
black lashes, strangely bright and feverish.
She came tripping across the rope, with a
laugh upon her lips, her hair glistening, under
the spotlight, almost pure gold in colour.
Bobbed and banged in the fashion of the Japanese
child, it yet curled about her exquisite
young face, and added the last touch of witchery
to her beauty. Though her bright red lips
were parted in the smile that had made her
mother famous, there was something appealing
in her wide, blank stare at her audience.</p>

<p class="indent">She was dressed in tights, without the customary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
cape above her, and her graceful, slender
limbs were those of extreme youth, supple
as elastic from training and ancestry, the lithe,
pliable young body of the born trapese performer
and dancer. She tossed her parasol to
her shoulder, threw up her delicate little
pointed chin and laughed across at that sea of
faces, throwing right and left her kisses; but
the Americans, close to the rope, were observing
a phenomenon, for even as her charming
little teeth gleamed out in that so captivating
smile, a dewdrop appeared to glisten on the
child's shining face. Even as she laughed and
postured to the music that burst out, there
a-tiptoe on the tightrope, the dewdrop fell
down her face and disappeared into the sawdust.</p>

<p class="indent">Like a flower on the end of a long slender
stalk, tossing in the wind, her lovely little head
swayed from side to side. Her small, speaking
hands, the wrists of which were lovelier
than those celebrated by the Japanese poet
who for fifteen years had penned his one-line
poems to her mother, followed the rhythm of
the music, and every part of that delicate
young body seemed to sensitively stir and move
to the pantomime dance of the tightrope.</p>

<p class="indent">In triumph, Hirata heard the loud &quot;Hee-i-i-!&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
and the sharp indrawing and expulsions
of breaths. Scrambling across the room,
puffing and expressing his satisfaction, came
the Lord of Negato, drunk with sake and
amorous for the child upon the rope. He
pushed his way past the besieging tea house
maidens, who proffered him sweets and tea and
sake. His hands went deep into his sleeves,
and drew forth a shining bauble. With ingratiating
cries to attract her attention, he
flung the jewel to the girl upon the rope. Returning
his smile, she whirled her fan wide
open, caught the gift upon it, and, laughing,
tossed it into the air. Juggling and playing
with the pretty toy, she kept it twirling in a
circle above her, caught it again on her fan,
and dropped it down onto the sawdust beneath.
Then, like a naughty child, pleased
over some trick, she danced back and forth
along the rope, as it swung wide with her.</p>

<p class="indent">A grunt of anger came from Hirata, who
approached near enough for her to see and be
intimidated by him, but she kept her gaze well
above his head, feigning neither to see him,
nor the still pressing Negato. He was calling
up to her now, clucking as one might at a dog,
and when at last her glance swept his, he threw
at her a handful of coin. This also she caught
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
neatly on her opened fan, and then, acting
upon a sudden impetuous and impish impulse,
she threw right in the face of her besieging
admirer. Jumping from the rope to the
ground, she smiled and bowed right and left,
kissed her hands to her audience, and vanished
into the teahouse.</p>

<p class="indent">With an imprecation, Hirata followed her
into the house. The little maiden, holding the
tray, and pausing to solicit the patronage of
the Americans, had watched the girl's exit with
troubled eyes, and now she said in English:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Now</i> Hirata will beat her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; demanded the young
man, who had rejected the proffered cup, and
was staring at her with such angry eyes that
Spring Morning dropped her own, and bobbed
her knees in apology for possible offence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; repeated Jerry
Hammond, determined upon securing an answer,
while his friends crowded about interested
also in the reply.</p>

<p class="indent">Half shielding her face with her fan, the
girl replied in a low voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always the master beats the apprentice
who do wrong. When her mother live, he do
not touch her child, but now Madame Many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Smiles is dead, and Hirata is very angry. He
will surely put the lash to-night upon her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean to tell me that that little girl
is being beaten because she threw back that
dirty gorilla's coin to him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Spring Morning nodded, and the tears that
came suddenly to her eyes revealed that the
girl within had all of her sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The devil she is!&quot; Jerry Hammond turned
to his friends, &quot;Are we going to stand for
this?&quot; demanded Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not by a dashed sight!&quot; shrilly responded
the youngest of the party, a youth of seventeen,
whose heavy bone-ribbed glasses gave
him a preternaturally wise look.</p>

<p class="indent">The older man of the party here interposed
with an admonitory warning:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, boys, I advise you to keep out of
these oriental scraps. We don't want to get
mixed up in any teahouse brawls. These Japanese
girls are used&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's not a Japanese girl,&quot; furiously denied
Jerry. &quot;She's as white as we are. Did
you see her hair?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;&quot; began Professor Barrowes,
but was instantly silenced by his clamouring
young charges.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I,&quot; said Jerry, &quot;propose to go on a privately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
conducted tour of investigation into the
infernal regions of that house of alleged joys.
If any of you fellows have cold feet, stay right
here snug with papa. I'll go it alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That was quite enough for the impetuous
youngsters. With a whoop of derision at the
idea of their having &quot;cold feet,&quot; they were
soon following Jerry in a rush upon the house
that was reminiscent of football days.</p>

<p class="indent">In the main hall of the teahouse a bevy of
girls were running about agitatedly, some of
them with their sleeves before their faces, crying.
Two little apprentices crouched up
against a screen, loudly moaning. There was
every evidence of upset and distress in the
House of a Thousand Joys. To Jerry's demand
for Hirata, he was met by a frightened
silence from the girls, and a stony faced, sinister-eyed
woman attempted to block the passage
of the young men, thus unconsciously revealing
the direction Hirata had gone. Instantly
Jerry was upon the screen and with
rough hand had shoved it aside. They penetrated
to an interior room that opened upon
an outbuilding, which was strung out like a
pavilion across the garden. At the end of this
long, empty structure, lit only by a single
lantern, the Americans found what they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
sought. Kneeling on the floor, in her skin
tights, her hands tied behind her with red cords
that cut into the delicate flesh, was the girl
who had danced on the rope. Through the
thin silk of her tights showed a red welt
where one stroke of the lash had fallen. Before
her, squatting on his heels, Hirata, one
hand holding the whip, and the other his suspended
pipe, was waiting for his slave to come
to terms. She had felt the first stroke of the
lash. It should be her first or last, according
to her promise.</p>

<p class="indent">As the Americans broke into the apartment,
Hirata arose partly to his knees and then to
his feet, and as he realized their intention, he
began to leap up and down shouting lustily:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oi!&mdash;Oi! Oi-i-i-!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry's fist found him under the chin, and
silenced him. With murmurs of sympathy
and anger, the young men cut the bonds of
the little girl. She fell limply upon the floor,
breathlessly sighing:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Arigato! Arigato! Arigato!&quot; (Thank
you.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hustle. Did you hear that gong! They're
summoning the police. Let's beat it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And leave her here at his mercy? Nothing
doing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Jerry had lifted the child bodily in his
arms, and tossed her across his shoulder. They
came out of the house and the gardens through
a hue and cry of alarmed attendants and inmates.
Hirata had crawled on hands and
knees into the main dance hall, and every
drum was beating upon the place. Above the
beat of the drums came the shrill outcry of
Hirata, yelling at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hotogoroshi!&quot; (Murder.)</p>

<p class="indent">Through a protecting lane made by his
friends, fled Jerry Hammond, the girl upon
his shoulder, a chattering, clattering, screeching
mob at his heels, out of the gardens and
into the dusky streets, under the benignant eye
of the Lady Moon, in whose honour a thousand
revellers and banquetters were celebrating.
Fleet of foot and strong as a young Atlas,
Jerry, buoyed up with excitement and rage,
fled like the wind before his pursuers, till presently
he came to the big brick house, the building
of which had been such a source of wonder
and amusement to the Japanese, but which had
ever afterwards housed white residents sojourning
in the city. With one foot Jerry kicked
peremptorily upon the door, and a moment
later a startled young Japanese butler flung
the heavy doors apart, and Jerry rushed in.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER II</p>

<p class="indent">She awoke on a great soft bed that seemed
to her wondering eyes as large as a room.
She was sunk in a veritable nest of down, and,
sitting up, she put out a little cautious hand
and felt and punched the great pillow to reassure
herself as to its reality. There was a
vague question trembling in the girl's mind as
to whether she might not, in fact, have escaped
from Hirata through the same medium as her
adored mother, and was now being wafted on
a snowy cloud along the eternal road to Nirvanna.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the small statue like figure at the foot
of the great mahogany bed moved. Memory
flooded the girl. She thought of her
mother, and a sob of anguish escaped her.
Crowding upon the mother came the memory
of that delirious moment upon the rope, when
feeling that her mother's spirit was animating
her body, she had faced the revellers. Followed
the shivering thought of Hirata&mdash;the
lash upon her shoulder, its sting paining so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
that the mere recollection caused her face to
blanch with terror, dissipated by the memory
of what had followed. Again she felt the exciting
thrill of that long flight through the
night on the shoulder of the strange young barbarian.
He had burst into the room like a
veritable god from the heavens, and it was impossible
to think of him otherwise than some
mighty spirit which the gods had sent to rescue
and save the unworthy child of the dancer. In
an instant, she was out of bed, her quick glance
searching the big room, as if somewhere
within it her benefactor was. She was still in
her sadly ragged tights, the red welt showing
where the silk had been split by the whip of
Hirata.</p>

<p class="indent">The maid approached and wrapped the girl
in one of her own kimonas. She was a silent
tongued, still faced woman, who spoke not at
all as she swiftly robed her charge. A servant
in the household of the Americans, she had
been summoned in the night to attend the
strange new visitor. Goto, the house boy, had
explained to Hatsu that the girl was a dancer
from a neighbouring teahouse, whom his young
masters had kidnapped. She was a great
prize, jealously to be guarded, whispered the
awed and gossiping Goto. Hatsu at first had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
her doubts on this score, for no dancer or teahouse
maiden within her knowledge had ever
worn hair of such a colour nor had skin which
was bleached as that of the dead. Hatsu had
discovered her charge in a sleep of complete exhaustion,
her soft fair hair tossed about her on
the pillow like that of a child.</p>

<p class="indent">Now as the maid removed the tawdry tights,
and arrayed the strange girl in a respectable
kimona, she recognised that those shapely and
supple limbs could only be the peculiar heritage
of a dancer and performer. A warmth
radiated lovingly through her hands as she
dressed the young creature confided to her
charge. It had never been the lot of Hatsu to
serve one as beautiful as this girl, and there
was something of maternal pride in her as she
fell to her task. There was necessity for haste,
for the &quot;Mr. American sirs&quot; were assembled
in the main room awaiting her. Hatsu's task
completed, she took the girl by the sleeve, and
led her into the big living room, where were her
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in the long loose robes of the elderly
maid, she appeared but a child, with her short
hair curling about her face, and her frankly
questioning eyes turning from one to the
other. There was an expression of mingled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
appeal and childish delight in that expressive
look that she turned upon them ere she knelt
on the floor. She made her obeisances with
art and grace, as a true apprentice of her
mother. Indeed, her head ceased not to bob
till a laughing young voice broke the spell of
silence that her advent had caused with:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cut it out, kid! We want to have a look
at you. Want to see what sort of prize we
pulled in the dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Promptly, obediently she rested back upon
her heels, her two small hands resting flatly
on her knees. She turned her face archly, as
if inviting inspection, much to the entertainment
of the now charmed circle. The apprentice
of the House of a Thousand Joys upheld
the prestige of her mother's charm. Even the
thin, elderly man, with the bright glasses over
which he seemed to peer with an evidently critical
and appraising air, softened visibly before
that mingled look of nave appeal and glowing
youth. The glasses were blinked from the
nose, and dangled by their gold string. He
approached nearer to the girl, again put on his
glasses, and subjected her through them to a
searching scrutiny, his trained eye resting
longer upon the shining hair of the girl. The
glasses blinked off again at the unabashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
wide smile of confidence in those extraordinary
eyes; he cleared his throat, prepared to deliver
an opinion and diagnosis upon the particular
species before his glass. Before he could speak,
Jerry broke in belligerently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;First of all, let's get this thing clear. She's
not going to be handed back to that blanketty
blank baboon. I'm responsible for her, and
I'm going to see that she gets a square deal
from this time on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl's eyes widened as she looked steadily
at the kindling face of the young man,
whom she was more than ever assured was a
special instrument of the gods. Professor
Barrowes cleared his throat noisily again, and
holding his glasses in his hand, punctuated and
emphasised his remarks:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young gentlemen, I suggest that we put
the matter in the hands of Mr. Blumenthal,
our consul here at Nagasaki. I do not know&mdash;I
will not express&mdash;my opinion of what our
rights are in the matter&mdash;er as to whether we
have in fact broken some law of Japan in&mdash;er&mdash;thus
forcibly bringing the&mdash;ah&mdash;young lady
to our home. I am inclined to think that we
are about to experience trouble&mdash;considerable
trouble I should say&mdash;with this man Hirata.
If my memory serves me right, I recall hearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
or reading somewhere that a master of such
a house has certain property right in these&mdash;er&mdash;young&mdash;ah&mdash;ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That may be true,&quot; admitted the especial
agent of the gods. &quot;Suppose she is owned by
this man. I'll bet that Japan is not so dashed
medival in its laws, that it permits a chimpanzee
like that to beat and ill-use even a slave,
and anyway, we'll give him all that's coming
to him if he tries to take her from us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He'll have his hands danged full trying!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl's champion this time was the youthful
one of the bone ribbed glasses. Looking
at him very gravely, she perceived his amazing
youth, despite the wise spectacles that had
at first deceived her. There was that about
him that made her feel he was very near to her
own age, which numbered less than fifteen
years. Across the intervening space between
them, hazily the girl thought, what a charming
playmate the boy of the bone ribbed glasses
would make. She would have liked to run
through the temple gardens with him, and
hide in the cavities of the fantastic rocks, where
Japanese children loved to play, and where
the wistful eyes of the solitary little apprentice
of the House of a Thousand Joys had
often longingly and enviously watched them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
Her new friend she was to know as &quot;Monty.&quot;
He had a fine long name with a junior on the
end of it also, but it took many years before
she knew her friends by other than the appellations
assigned to them by each other.</p>

<p class="indent">Now the elderly man&mdash;perhaps he was the
father, thought the girl on the mat&mdash;was again
speaking in that emphatic tone of authority.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now my young friends, we have come to
Japan with a view to studying the country and
people, and to avail ourselves of such pleasures
as the country affords to its tourists, etc., and,
I may point out, that it was no part of our
programme or itinerary to take upon ourselves
the responsibility and burden, I may
say, of&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have&mdash;a heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The big slow voice came from the very fat
young man, whose melancholy expression belied
the popular conception of the comical element
associated with those blessed with excessive
flesh. &quot;Jinx,&quot; as his chums called him,
was the scion of a house of vast wealth and
fame, and it was no fault of his that his heritage
had been rich also in fat, flesh and bone.
But now the girl's first friend, with that manner
of the natural leader among men, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
again taken matters into his own evidently
competent hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, Jinx, suppose you beat it over to
the consul's and get what advice and dope you
can from him. Tell him we purpose carrying
the case to Washington and so forth. And
you, Monty and Bobs, skin over to the teahouse
and scare the guts out of that chimpanzee.
Hire a bunch of Japs and cops to
help along with the noise. Give him the scare
of his life. Tell him she&mdash;she is&mdash;dying&mdash;at
her last gasp and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">(Surely the object of their concern understood
the English language, for just then several
unexpected dimples sprang abroad, and
the little row of white teeth showed that smile
that was her heritage from her mother.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell him,&quot; went on Jerry, a bit unevenly,
deviated from his single track of thought by
that most engaging and surprising smile&mdash;&quot;that
we'll have him boiled in oil or lava or
some other Japanese concoction. Toddle
along, old dears, or that fellow with the face
supporting the Darwinian theory will get
ahead of us with the police.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's your hurry?&quot; growled Jinx, his
sentimental gaze resting fascinatedly upon the
girl on the floor.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The young man Jerry had referred to as
Bobs now suggested that there was a possibility
that the girl was deaf and dumb, in
view of the fact that she had not spoken once.
This alarming suggestion created ludicrous
consternation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where's that dictionary, confound it!&quot;
Jerry sought the elusive book in sundry portions
of his clothing, and then appealed to the
oracle of the party.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suggest,&quot; said Professor Barrowes
didactically, &quot;that you try the&mdash;ah&mdash;young
lady&mdash;with the common Japanese greeting. I
believe you all have learned it by now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Promptly there issued from four American
mouths the musical morning greeting of the
Japanese, reminiscent to them of a well known
State productive of presidents.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O&mdash;hi&mdash;o!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The effect on the girl was instantaneous.
She arose with grace to her feet, put her two
small hands on her two small knees, bobbed up
and down half a dozen times, and then with
that white row of pearls revealed in an irresistible
smile, she returned:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goog&mdash;a&mdash;morning!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a swelling of chests at this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
Pride in their protg aroused them to enthusiastic
expressions.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you beat it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you hear her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's a cute kid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And from Monty:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I could have told you from the first that a
girl with hair and eyes like that wouldn't be
chattering any monkey speech.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thereupon the girl, uttered another jewel
in English, which called forth not merely approbation,
but loud and continuous applause,
laughter, and fists clapped into hands. Said
the girl:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I speag those mos' bes' Angleesh ad
Japan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll say you do,&quot; agreed Monty with enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh!&quot; said Jinx sadly. &quot;She's the cutest
kid <i>I've</i> ever seen.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old are you?&quot; Jerry put the question
gently, touched, despite the merriment her
words had occasioned, by something forlorn in
the little figure on the mat before them, so evidently
anxious to please them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How ole?&quot; Her expressive face showed
evidence of deep regret at having to admit the
humiliating fact that her years numbered but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
fourteen and ten months. She was careful
to add the ten months to the sum of her years.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what's your name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are got two names.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We all have that&mdash;Christian and surname
we call 'em. What's yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are got Angleesh name&mdash;Fleese. You
know those name?&quot; she inquired anxiously.
&quot;Thas Angleesh name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fleese! Fleese!&quot; Not one of them but
wanted to assure her that &quot;Fleese&quot; was a well
known name in the English tongue, but even
Professor Barrowes, an authority on the roots
of all names, found &quot;Fleese&quot; a new one. She
was evidently disappointed, and said in a
slightly depressed voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are sawry you do not know thad Angleesh
name. My father are give me those
name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have it! I have it!&quot; Bobs, who had been
scribbling something on paper, and repeating
it with several accents, shouted that the name
the girl meant was undoubtedly &quot;Phyllis,&quot; and
at that she nodded her head so vigorously,
overjoyed that he threw back his head and
burst into laughter, which was loudly and most
joyously and ingenuously entered into by
&quot;Phyllis&quot; also.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So that's your name&mdash;Phyllis,&quot; said Jerry.
&quot;You <i>are</i> English then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head, sighing with regret.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I sawry for those. I <i>lig'</i> be Angleesh.
Thas nize be Angleesh; but me, I are not those.
Also I are got Japanese name. It are Sunlight.
My mother&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Her face became
instantly serious as she mentioned her mother,
and bowed her head to the floor reverently.
&quot;My honourable mother have give me that
Japanese name&mdash;Sunlight, but my father are
change those name. He are call me&mdash;Sunny.
This whad he call me when he go away&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
Her voice trailed off forlornly, hurt by a memory
that went back to her fifth year.</p>

<p class="indent">They wanted to see her smile again, and
Jerry cried enthusiastically:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! Sunny! What a corking little
name! It sounds just like you look. We'll
call you that too&mdash;Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Professor Barrowes, too long in the
background, came to the fore with precision.
He had been scratching upon a pad of paper
a number of questions he purposed to put to
Sunny, as she was henceforth to be known to
her friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have a few questions I desire to ask the
young&mdash;ah&mdash;lady, if you have no objection.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
I consider it advisable for us to ascertain what
we properly can about the history of Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Sunny&mdash;and
so, if you will allow me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He cleared his throat, referred to the paper
in his hand and propounded the first question
as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Question number one: Are you a white
or a Japanese girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Answer from Sunny:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are white on my face and my honourable
body, but I are Japanese on my honourable insides.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Muffled mirth followed this reply, and Professor
Barrowes having both blown his nose and
cleared his throat applied his glasses to his
nose but was obliged to wait a while before resuming,
and then:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Question number two: Who were or are
your parents? Japanese or white people?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, her cheeks very red and her eyes
very bright:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aexcuse me. I are god no parents or ancestors
on those worl'. I sawry. I miserable
girl wizout no ancestor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Question number three: You had parents.
You remember them. What nationality
was your mother? I believe Madame Many
Smiles was merely her professional pseudonym.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
I have heard her variously described
as white, partly white, half caste. What was
she&mdash;a white woman or a Japanese?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was thinking of that radiant little
mother as last she had seen her in the brilliant
dancing robes of the dead geisha. The questions
were touching the throbbing cords of a
memory that pierced. Over the sweet young
face a shadow crept.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My m-mother,&quot; said Sunny softly, &quot;are
god two bloods ad her insides. Her father are
Lussian gentleman and her mother are Japanese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And your father?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A far-away look came into the girl's eyes as
she searched painfully back into that past that
held such sharply bright and poignantly sad
memories of the father she had known such a
little time. She no longer saw the eager young
faces about her, or the kindly one of the man
who questioned her. Sunny was looking out
before her across the years into that beautiful
past, wherein among the cherry blossoms she
had wandered with her father. It was he who
had changed her Japanese name of Sunlight
to &quot;Sunny.&quot; A psychologist might have found
in this somewhat to redeem him from his sins
against his child and her mother, for surely the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
name revealed a softness of the heart which
his subsequent conduct might have led a
sceptical world to doubt. Moreover, the first
language of her baby lips was that of her
father, and for five years she knew no other
tongue. She thought of him always as of some
gay figure in a bright dream that fled away
suddenly into the cruel years that followed.
There had been days of real terror and fear,
when Sunny and her mother had taken the
long trail of the mendicant, and knew what it
was to feel hunger and cold and the chilly hand
of charity. The mere memory of those days
set the girl shivering, for it seemed such a short
time since when she and that dearest mother
crouched outside houses that, lighted within,
shone warmly, like gaudy paper lanterns in
the night; of still darker days of discomfort and
misery, when they had hidden in bush, bramble
and in dark woods beyond the paths of men.
There had been a period of sweet rest and
refuge in a mountain temple. There everything
had appealed to the imaginative child.
Tinkling bells and whirring wings of a thousand
doves, whose home was in gilded loft and
spire; bald heads of murmuring bonzes; waving
sleeves of the visiting priestesses, dancing
before the shrine to please the gods; the weary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
pilgrims who climbed to the mountain's heart
to throw their prayers in the lap of the peaceful
Buddha. A hermitage in a still wood,
where an old, old nun, with gentle feeble voice,
crooned over her rosary. All this was as a
song that lingers in one's ears long after the
melody has passed&mdash;a memory that stung with
its very sweetness. Even here the fugitives
were not permitted to linger for long.</p>

<p class="indent">Pursuing shadows haunted her mother's
footsteps and sent her speeding ever on. She
told her child that the shadows menaced their
safety. They had come from across the west
ocean, said the mother. They were barbarian
thieves of the night, whose mission was to separate
mother from child, and because separation
from her mother spelled for little Sunny
a doom more awful than death itself, she was
wont to smother back her child's cries in her
sleeve, and bravely and silently push onward.
So for a period of time of which neither
mother nor child took reckoning the days of
their vagabondage passed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came a night when they skirted the
edges of a city of many lights; lights that hung
like stars in the sky; lights that swung over the
intricate canals that ran into streets in and out
of the city; harbour lights from great ships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
that steamed into the port; the countless little
lights of junks and fisher boats, and the merry
lights that shone warmly inside the pretty
paper houses that bespoke home and rest to
the outcasts. And they came to a brilliantly
lighted garden, where on long poles and lines
the lanterns were strung, and within the gates
they heard the chattering of the drum, and the
sweet tinkle of the samisen. Here at the gates
of the House of a Thousand Joys the mother
touched the gongs. A man with a lantern in
his hand came down to the gates, and as the
woman spoke, he raised the light till it revealed
that delicate face, whose loveliness neither pain
nor privation nor time nor even death had
ravaged.</p>

<p class="indent">After that, the story of the geisha was well
known. Her career had been an exceptional
one in that port of many teahouses. From the
night of her dbut to the night of her death
the renown of Madame Many Smiles had been
undimmed.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, looking out before her, in a sad
study, that caught her up into the web of the
vanished years, could only shake her head
dumbly at her questioner, as he pressed her:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your father&mdash;you have not answered me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I kinnod speag about my&mdash;father. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
sawry, honourable sir,&quot; and suddenly the
child's face drooped forward as if she humbly
bowed, but the young men watching her saw
the tears that dropped on her clasped hands.</p>

<p class="indent">Exclamations of pity and wrath burst from
them impetuously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We've no right to question her like this,&quot;
declared Jerry Hammond hotly. &quot;It's not of
any consequence who her people are. She's
got us now. We'll take care of her from this
time forth.&quot; At that Sunny again raised her
head, and right through her tears she smiled up
at Jerry. It made him think of an April
shower, the soft rain falling through the sunlight.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER III</p>

<p class="indent">Only one who has been in bondage all of
his days can appreciate that thrill that
comes with sudden freedom. The Americans
had set Sunny free. She had been bound by
law to the man Hirata through an iniquitous
bond that covered all the days of her young life&mdash;a
bond into which the average geisha is sold
in her youth. Sunny's mother had signed the
contract when starvation faced them, and reassured
by the promises of Hirata.</p>

<p class="indent">What price and terms the avaricious Hirata
extracted from the Americans is immaterial,
but they took precautions that the proceeding
should be in strict accord with the legal requirements
of Japan. The American consul
and Japanese lawyers governed the transaction.
Hirata, gloated with the unexpected
fortune that had come to him through the sale
of the apprentice-geisha, overwhelmed the disgusted
young men, whom he termed now his
benefactors, with servile compliments, and
hastened to comply with all their demands,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
which included the delivery to Sunny of the
effects of her mother. Goto bore the box containing
her mother's precious robes and personal
belongings into the great living room.</p>

<p class="indent">Life had danced by so swiftly and strangely
for Sunny in these latter days, that she had
been diverted from her sorrow. Now, as she
slowly opened the bamboo chest, with its intangible
odour of dear things, she experienced
a strangling sense of utter loss and pain.
Never again would she hear that gentle voice,
admonishing and teaching her; never again
would she rest her tired head on her mother's
knee and find rest and comfort from the sore
trials of the day; for the training of the apprentice-geisha
is harsh and spartan like. As
Sunny lifted out her mother's sparkling robe,
almost she seemed to see the delicate head
above it. A sob broke from the heart of the
girl, and throwing herself on the floor by the
chest, she wept with her face in the silken
folds. A moth fluttered out of one of the
sleeves, and hung tremulously above the girl's
head. Sunny, looking up, addressed it reverently:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not hurt you, little moth. It may be
you are the spirit of my honourable mother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
Pray you go upon your way,&quot; and she softly
blew up at the moth.</p>

<p class="indent">It was that element of helplessness, a feminine
quality of appeal about Sunny, that
touched something in the hearts of her American
friends that was chivalrous and quixotic.
Always, when Sunny was in trouble, they took
the jocular way of expressing their feelings
for their charge. To tease, joke, chaff and
play with Sunny, that was their way. So, on
this day, when they returned to the house, to
find the girl with her tear-wet face pressed
against her mother's things, they sought an
instant means, and as Jerry insisted, a practical
one, of banishing her sadness. After the
box had been taken from the room, Goto and
Jinx told some funny stories, which brought
a faint smile to Sunny's face. Monty
proffered a handful of sweets picked up in
some adjacent shop, while Bobs sought scientifically
to arouse her to a semblance of her
buoyant spirits by discussing all the small live
things that were an unfailing source of interest
always to the girl, and pretended an enthusiasm
over white rabbits which he declared
were in the garden. Jerry broached his marvellous
plan, pronounced by Professor Barrowes
to be preposterous, unheard of and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
impossible. In Jerry's own words, the scheme
was as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I propose that we organise and found a
company or Syndicate, all present to have the
privilege of owning stock in said company;
its purpose being to take care of Sunny for
the rest of her days. Sooner or later we fellows
must return to the U. S. We are going
to provide for Sunny's future after we are
gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus the Sunny Syndicate Limited came
into being. It was capitalised at $10,000,
paid in capital, a considerable sum in Japan,
and quite sufficient to keep the girl in comfort
for the rest of her days. Professor Timothy
Barrowes was unanimously elected President,
J. Lyon Crawford (Jinx) treasurer; Robert
M. Mapson (Bobs), secretary of the concern,
and Joseph Lamont Potter, Jr. (Monty),
though under age, after an indignant argument
was permitted to hold a minimum
measure of stock and also voted a director.
J. Addison Hammond, Jr. (Jerry), held
down the positions of first vice-president,
managing director and general manager and
was grudgingly admitted to be the founder
and promoter of the great idea, and the discoverer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
of Sunny, assets of aforesaid Syndicate.</p>

<p class="indent">At the initial Board meeting of the Syndicate,
which was riotously attended, the purpose
of the Syndicate was duly set forth in the
minutes read, approved and signed by all,
which was, to wit, to feed, clothe, educate and
furnish with sundry necessities and luxuries
the aforesaid Sunny for the rest of her natural
days.</p>

<p class="indent">The education of Sunny strongly appealed
to the governing president, who, despite his
original protest, was the most active member
of the Syndicate. He promptly outlined a
course which would tend to cultivate those
hitherto unexplored portions of Sunny's pliable
young mind. A girl of almost fifteen,
unable to read or write, was in the opinion of
Professor Barrowes a truly benighted heathen.
What matter that she knew the Greater
Learning for Women by heart, knew the
names of all the gods and goddesses cherished
by the Island Empire; had an intimate acquaintance
with the Japanese language, and
was able to translate and indite epistles in
the peculiar figures intelligible only to the
Japanese. The fact remained that she was
in a state of abysmal ignorance so far as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
American education was concerned. Her
friends assured her of the difficulty of their
task, and impressed upon her the necessity of
hard study and co-operation on her part. She
was not merely to learn the American language,
she was, with mock seriousness, informed,
but she was to acquire the American
point of view, and in fact unlearn much of the
useless knowledge she had acquired of things
Japanese.</p>

<p class="indent">To each member of the Syndicate Professor
Barrowes assigned a subject in which he was
to instruct Sunny. Himself he appointed
principal of the &quot;seminary&quot; as the young men
merrily named it; Jerry was instructor in
reading and writing, Bobs in spelling, Jinx
in arithmetic, and to young Monty, aged
seventeen, was intrusted the task of instructing
Sunny in geography, a subject Professor
Barrowes well knew the boy was himself deficient
in. He considered this an ideal opportunity,
in a sort of inverted way, to instruct
Monty himself. To the aid and help of the
Americans came the Reverend Simon Sutherland,
a missionary, whose many years of service
among the heathen had given to his face
that sadly solemn expression of martyr zealot.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
His the task to transform Sunny into a respectable
Christian girl.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny's progress in her studies was eccentric.
There were times when she was able to
read so glibly and well that the pride of her
teacher was only dashed when he discovered
that she had somehow learned the words by
heart, and in picking them out had an exasperating
habit of pointing to the wrong words.
She could count to ten in English. Her progress
in Geography was attested to by her
admiring and enthusiastic teacher, and she herself,
dimpling, referred to the U. S. A. as
being &quot;over cross those west water, wiz grade
flag of striped stars.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, her advance in religion exceeded
all her other attainments, and filled the breast
of the good missionary with inordinate pride.
An expert and professional in the art of converting
the heathen, he considered Sunny's
conversion at the end of the second week as
little short of miraculous, and, as he explained
to the generous young Americans, who had
done so much for the mission school in which
the Reverend Simon Sutherland was interested,
he was of the opinion that the girl's
quick comprehension of the religion was due
to a sort of reversion to type, she being mainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
of white blood. So infatuated indeed was the
good man by his pupil's progress that he could
not forbear to bring her before her friends, and
show them what prayer and sincere labour
among the heathen were capable of doing.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, the willing and joyous convert
was haled before an admiring if somewhat
sceptical circle in the cheerful living room of
the Americans. Here, her hands clasped
piously together, she chanted the prepared
formula:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentlemens&quot;&mdash;Familiar daily intercourse
with her friends brought easily to the girl's
tongue their various nicknames, but &quot;Gentlemens&quot;
she now addressed them.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I stan here to make statements to you that
I am turn Kirishitan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;English, my dear child. Use the English
language, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;that I am turn those Christian girl. I
can sing those&mdash;a-gospel song; and I are speak
those&mdash;ah&mdash;gospel prayer, and I know those
cat&mdash;cattykussem like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny wavered as she caught the uplifted
eyebrow of the missionary signalling to her
behind the back of Professor Barrowes. Now
the words began to fade away from Sunny.
Alone with the missionary it was remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
how quickly she was able to commit things to
memory. Before an audience like this, she was
as a child who stands upon a platform with
his first recitation, and finds his tongue tied
and memory failing. What was it now the
Reverend Simon Sutherland desired her to
say? Confused, but by no means daunted,
Sunny cast about in her mind for some method
of propitiating the minister. At least, she
could pray. Folding her hands before her,
and dropping her Buddhist rosary through her
fingers, she murmured the words of that quaint
old hymn:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;What though those icy breeze,</span><br />
<span class="i4">He blow sof' on ze isle</span><br />
<span class="i4">Though evrything he pleases</span><br />
<span class="i4">And jos those man he's wild,</span><br />
<span class="i4">In vain with large kind</span><br />
<span class="i4">The gift of those gods are sown,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Those heathen in blindness</span><br />
<span class="i4">Bow down to wood and stone.&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">They let her finish the chant, the words of
which were almost unintelligible to her convulsed
audience, who vainly sought to strangle
their mirth before the crestfallen and sadly
hurt Mr. Sutherland. He took the rosary
from Sunny's fingers, saying reprovingly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear child, that is not a prayer, and
how many times must I tell you that we do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
not use a rosary in our church. All we desire
from you at this time is a humble profession
as to your conversion to Christianity. Therefore,
my child, your friends and I wish to be
reassured on that score.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd like to hear her do the catechism. She
says she knows it,&quot; came in a muffled voice
from Bobs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certainly, certainly,&quot; responded the missionary.
&quot;Attention, my dear. First, I will
ask you: What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, watching him with the most painful
earnestness indicative of her earnest desire to
please, was able to answer at once joyously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name are Sunny&mdash;Syndicutt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mirth was barely suppressed by the
now indignant minister, who glared in displeasure
upon the small person so painfully
trying to realise his ambitions for her. To
conciliate the evidently angry Mr. Sutherland,
she rattled along hurriedly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am true convert. I swear him. By those
eight million gods of the heavens and the sea,
and by God-dam I swear it that I am nixe
Kirishitan girl.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">A few minutes later Sunny was alone, even
Professor Barrowes having hastily followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
his charges from the room to avoid giving
offence to the missionary, whose angry tongue
was now loosened, and flayed the unhappy girl
ere he too departed in dudgeon via the front
door.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">That evening, after the dinner, Sunny, who
had been very quiet during the meal, went directly
from the table to her room upstairs, and
to the calls after her of her friends, she replied
that she had &quot;five thousan words to learn him
to spell.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes, furtively wiping his
eyes and then his glasses, shook them at his
protesting young charges and asserted that the
missionary was quite within his rights in punishing
Sunny by giving her 500 lines to write.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's been at it all day,&quot; was the disgusted
comment of Monty. &quot;It's a rotten shame, to
put that poor kid to copying that little hell
of a line.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sir,&quot; said the Professor, stiffening and
glaring through his glasses at Monty, &quot;I wish
you to know that line happens to be taken from
a&mdash;er&mdash;book esteemed sacred, and I have yet
to learn that it had its origin in the infernal
regions as suggested by you. What is more,
I may say that Miss Sunny's progress in reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
and spelling, arithmetic, and geography
has not been what I had hoped. Accordingly
I have instructed her that she must study for
an hour in the evening after dinner, and I have
further advised the young lady that I do not
wish her to leave the house on any pleasure
expedition this evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A howl of indignant protest greeted this
pronouncement and the air was electric with
bristling young heads.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, Proff. Sunny promised to go out
with me this evening. She knows a shop where
they sell that sticky gum drop stuff that I like,
and we're going down Snowdrop Ave. to
Canal Lane. Let her off, just this time, will
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will not. She must learn to spell Cat,
Cow, Horse and Dog and such words as a
baby of five knows properly before she can
go out on pleasure trips.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx ponderously sat up on his favourite
sofa, the same creaking under him as the big
fellow moved. In an injured tone he set forth
his rights for the evening to Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny has a date with me to play me a nice
little sing-song on that Jap guitar of hers.
I'm not letting her off this or any other night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She made a date with me too,&quot; laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
Bobs. &quot;We were to star gaze, if you please.
She says she knows the history of all the most
famous stars in the heavens, and she agreed
to show me the exact geographical spot in the
firmament where that Amaterumtumtum, or
whatever she calls it, goddess, lost her robes in
the Milky Way just while she was descending
to earth to be an ancestor to the Emperor of
Japan.&quot; Mockingly Bobs bowed his head in
solemn and comical imitation of Sunny at
the mention of the Emperor.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry was thinking irritably that Sunny and
he were to have stolen away after supper for
a little trip in a private junk, owned by a
friend of Sunny's, and she said that the rowers
would play the guitar and sing as the gondoliers
of Italy do. Jerry had a fancy for
that trip in the moonlight, with Sunny's little
hand cuddled up in his, and the child chattering
some of her pretty nonsense. Confound
it, the little baggage had promised her time
to every last one of her friends, and so it was
nearly every night in the week. Sunny had
much ado making and breaking engagements
with her friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It strikes me,&quot; said Professor Barrowes,
stroking his chin humorously, &quot;that Miss
Sunny has in her all the elements that go to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
the making of a most complete and finished
coquette. For your possible edification, gentlemen,
I will mention that the young lady also
offered to accompany me to a certain small
temple where she informs me a bonze of the
Buddhist religion has a library of er&mdash;one
million years, so claims Miss Sunny, and this
same bonze she assured me has a unique collection
of ancient butterflies which have come
down from prehistoric days. Ahem!&mdash;er&mdash;I
shall play fair with you young gentlemen.
I desire very much to see the articles I have
mentioned. I doubt very much the authenticity
of the same, but have an open mind. I
shall, however, reserve the pleasure of seeing
these collections till a more convenient period.
In the meanwhile I advise you all to go about
your respective concerns, and I bid you good-night,
gentlemen, I bid you good-night.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The house was silent. The living room, with
its single reading lamp, seemed empty and
cold, and Professor Barrowes with a book
whose contents would have aforetime utterly
absorbed him, as it dealt with the fascinating
subject of the Dinornis, of post-Pliocene days,
found himself unable to concentrate. His
well-governed mind had in some inexplicable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
way become intractable. It persisted in wandering
up to the floor above, where Professor
Barrowes knew was a poor young girl, who
was studying hard into the night. Twice he
went outdoors to assure himself that Sunny
was still studying, and each time the glowing
light, and the chanting voice aroused his further
compunction and remorse. Unable
longer to endure the distracting influence that
took his mind from his favourite study, the
Professor stole on tiptoe up the stairs to
Sunny's door. The voice inside went raucously
on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;C-a-t&mdash;dog. C-a-t&mdash;dog. C-a-t&mdash;dog!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something about that voice, devoid of all the
charm peculiar to Sunny, grated against the
sensitive ear at the keyhole, and accordingly he
withdrew the ear and applied the eye. What
he saw inside caused him to sit back solidly on
the floor, speechless with mirthful indignation.</p>

<p class="indent">Hatsu, the maid, sat stonily before the little
desk of her mistress, and true to the instructions
of Sunny, she was loudly chanting that
C-a-t spelled Dog.</p>

<p class="indent">Outside the window&mdash;well, there was a lattice
work that ascended conveniently to
Sunny's room. Her mode of exit was visible
to the simplest minded, but the question that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
agitated the mind of Professor Barrowes, and
sent him off into a spree of mirthful speculation
was which one of the members of the
Sunny Syndicate Limited had Miss Sunny
Sindicutt eloped with?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IV</p>

<p class="indent">To be adopted by four young men and one
older one; to be surrounded by every care
and luxury; to be alternately scolded, pampered,
admonished and petted, this was the
joyous fate of Sunny. Life ran along for the
happy child like a song, a poem which even
Takumushi could not have composed.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny greeted the rising sun with the kisses
that she had been taught to throw to garden
audiences, and hailed the blazing orb each
morning, having bowed three times, hands on
knees, with words like these:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ohayo! honourable Sun. I glad you come
again. Thas a beautiful day you are bring,
an I thang you thad I are permit to live on
those day. Hoh! Amaterasuoho-mikami,
shining lady of the Sun, I are mos' happiest
girl ad those Japan!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The professional geisha is taught from
childhood&mdash;for her apprenticeship begins from
earliest youth&mdash;that her mission in life is to
bring joy and happiness into the world, to divert,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
to banish all care by her own infectious
buoyancy, to heal, to dissipate the cares of
mere mortals; to cultivate herself so that she
shall become the very essence of joy. If
trouble comes to her own life, to so exercise
self-control that no trace of her inner distress
must be reflected in her looks or conduct. She
must, in fact, make a science of her profession.
To laugh with those who laugh and weep with
those who find a balm in tears&mdash;that is the
work of the geisha.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, a product of the geisha house, and
herself apprentice to the joy women of Japan,
was of another race by blood, yet always there
was to cling to her that intangible charm, that
like a strange perfume bespeaks the geisha of
Japan. In her odd way Sunny laid out her
campaign to charm and please the ones who
had befriended her, and toward whom she felt
a gratitude that both touched and embarrassed
them.</p>

<p class="indent">Her new plan of life, however, violated all
the old rules which had governed in the teahouse.
Sunny was sore put to it to adjust
herself to the novelty of a life that knew not
the sharp and imperative voice, which cut like
a whip in staccato order, from the master of
the geishas; nor the perilous trapeze, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
swinging rope, to fall from which was to bring
down upon her head harsh rebuke, and sometimes
the threatening flash of the whip, whirling
in the air, and barely scraping the girl on
the rope. She had been whipped but upon
that one occasion, for her mother was too
valuable an asset in the House of a Thousand
Joys for Hirata to risk offending; but always
he loved to swing the lash above the girl's
head, or hurl it near to the feet that had faltered
from the rope, so that she might know
that it hung suspended above her to fall at
a time when she failed. There were pleasant
things too in the House of a Thousand Smiles
that Sunny missed&mdash;the tap tap of the drum,
the pat pat of the stockinged feet on the polished
dance matting; the rising and falling of
the music of the samisen as it tinkled in time
to the swaying fans and posturing bodies of
the geishas. All this was the joyous part of
that gaudy past, which her honourable new
owners had bidden her forget.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny desired most earnestly to repay her
benefactors, but her offers to dance for them
were laughingly joshed aside, and she was told
that they did not wish to be repaid in dancing
coin. All they desired in return was that she
should be happy, forget the bitter past, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
they always added &quot;grow up to be the most
beautiful girl in Japan.&quot; This was a joking
formula among them. To order Sunny to be
merely happy and beautiful. Happy she was,
but beauty! Ah! that was more difficult.</p>

<p class="indent">Beauty, thought Sunny, must surely be the
aim and goal of all Americans. Many were
the moments when she studied her small face
in the mirror, and regretted that it would be
impossible for her to realise the ambition of
her friends. Her face, she was assured, violated
all the traditions and canons of the Japanese
ideal of beauty. That required jet
black hair, lustrous as lacquer, a long oval face,
with tiny, carmine touched lips, narrow, inscrutable
eyes, a straight, sensitive nose, a
calmness of expression and poise that should
serve as a mask to all internal emotions; above
all an elegance and distinction in manners and
dress that would mark one as being of an elevated
station in life. Now Sunny's hair was
fair, and despite brush and oil generously
applied, till forbidden by her friends, it curled
in disobedient ringlets about her young face.
The hair alone marked her in the estimation
of the Japanese as akin to the lower races,
since curly hair was one of the marks peculiar
to the savages. Neither were her eyes according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
to the Japanese ideal of beauty. They
were, it is true, long and shadowed by the
blackest of lashes, and in fact were her one
feature showing the trace of her oriental taint
or alloy, for they tipped up somewhat at the
corners, and she had a trick of glancing sideways
through the dark lashes that her
friends found eerily fascinating; unfortunately
those eyes were large, and instead of
being the prescribed black, were pure amber
in colour, with golden lights of the colour of
her hair. Her skin, finally, was, as the mentor
of the geisha house had primly told her,
bleached like the skin of the dead. Save where
the colour flooded her cheeks like peach bloom,
Sunny's skin was as white as snow, and all the
temporary stains and dark powder applied
could not change the colour of her skin. To
one accustomed to the Japanese point of view,
Sunny therefore could see nothing in her own
lovely face that would realise the desire of her
friends that she should be beautiful; but respectfully
and humbly she promised them that
she would try to obey them, and she carried
many gifts and offerings to the feet of Amaterasu-ohomikami,
whose beauty had made her
the supreme goddess of the heavens.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beauty,&quot; said Jerry Hammond, walking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
up and down the big living room, his hair
rumpled, and his hands loosely in his pockets,
&quot;is the aim and end of all that is worth while
in life, Sunny. If we have it, we have everything.
Beauty is something we are unable to
define. It is elusive as a feather that floats
above our heads. A breath will blow it beyond
our reach, and a miracle will bring it to our
hand. Now, the gods willing, I am going to
spend all of the days of my life pursuing and
reaching after Beauty. Despite my parents'
fond expectations of a commercial career for
their wayward son, I propose to be an artist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">From which it will be observed that Jerry's
idea of beauty was hardly that comprehended
by Sunny, though in a vague way she sensed
also his ideal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An artist!&quot; exclaimed she, clasping her
hands with enthusiasm. &quot;Ho! <i>how</i> thad will
be grade. I thing you be more grade artist
than Hokusai!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Sunny, impossible! Hokusai was one
of the greatest artists that ever lived. I'm not
built of the same timber, Sunny.&quot; There was
a touch of sadness to Jerry's voice. &quot;My
scheme is not to paint pictures. I propose to
beautify cities. To the world I shall be known
merely as an architect, but you and I, Sunny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
we will know, won't we, that I am an artist;
because, you see, even if one fails to create the
beautiful, the hunger and the desire for it is
just as important. It's like being a poet at
heart, without being able to write poetry.
Now some fellows <i>write</i> poetry of a sort&mdash;but
they are not poets&mdash;not in their thought and
lives, Sunny. I'd rather be a poet than write
poetry. Do you understand that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&mdash;I understand,&quot; said Sunny softly.
&quot;The liddle butterfly when he float on the
flower, he cannot write those poetry&mdash;but he
are a poem; and the honourable cloud in those
sky, so sof', so white, so loavely he make one's
heart leap up high at chest&mdash;thas poem too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Sunny, what a perfect treasure you
are! I'm blessed if you don't understand a
fellow better than one of his own countrywomen
would.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To cover a feeling of emotion and sentiment
that invariably swept over Jerry when he
talked with Sunny on the subject of beauty,
and because moreover there was that about
her own upturned face that disturbed him
strangely, he always assumed a mock serious
air, and affected to tease her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But to get back to you, Sunny. Now, all
you've got to do to please the Syndicate is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
be a good girl <i>and</i> beautiful. It ought not to
be hard, because you see you've got such a
bully start. Keep on, and who knows you'll
end not only by being the most beautiful girl
in Japan, but the Emperor himself&mdash;the Emperor
of Japan, mark you, will step down from
his golden throne, wave his wand toward you
and marry you! So there you'll be&mdash;the royal
Empress of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Emperor!&quot; Sunny's head went reverently
to the mats. Her eyes, very wide, met
Jerry's in shocked question. &quot;You want me
marry wiz&mdash;the Son of Heaven? <i>How</i> I can
do those?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again her head touched the floor, her curls
bobbing against flushed cheeks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Easy as fishing,&quot; solemnly Jerry assured
her. &quot;They say the old dub is quite approachable,
and you've only to let him see you once,
and that will be enough for him. Just think,
Sunny, what that will mean to you, and to us
all&mdash;to be Empress of Japan. Why, you will
only need to wave your hand or sleeve, and
all sorts of favours will descend upon our
heads. You will be able to repay us threefold
for any insignificant service we may have done
for you. Once Empress of Japan, you can
summon us back to these fair isles and turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
over to us all the political plums of the Empire.
As soon as you give us the high sign, old scout,
we'll be right on the job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, you like very much those plum?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You better believe I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, chin in hand, was off in a mood of
abstraction. She was thinking very earnestly
of the red plum tree that grew above the tomb
of the great Lord of Kakodate. He, that
sleeping lord, would not miss a single plum,
and she would go to the cemetery in the early
morning, and when she had accomplished the
theft, she would pray at the temple for absolution
for her sin, which would not be so
bad because Sunny would have sinned for love.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A penny for your thoughts, Sunny!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are think, Jerry, that some things you
ask me I can do; others, no&mdash;thas not possible.
Wiz this liddle hand I cannod dip up
the ocean. Thas proverb of our Japan. I
cannod marry those Emperor, and me? I
cannod also make beauty on my face.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give it a try, Sunny,&quot; jeered Jerry, laughing
at her serious face. &quot;You have no idea
what time and art will do for one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Time&mdash;and&mdash;art,&quot; repeated Sunny, like a
child learning a lesson. She comprehended
time, but she had inherited none of the Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
traits of patience. She would have
wished to leap over that first obstacle to
beauty. Art, she comprehended, as a physical
aid to a face and form unendowed with the
desired beauty. She carried her problem to
her maid.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatsu, have you ever seen the Emperor?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both of their heads bobbed quickly to the
mat.</p>

<p class="indent">Hatsu had not. She had, it is true, walked
miles through country roads, on a hot, dry
day, to reach the nearest town through which
the Son of Heaven's cortege had once passed.
But, of course, as the royal party approached,
Hatsu, like all the peasants who had come to
the town on this gala day, had fallen face
downward on the earth. It was impossible for
her therefore to see the face of the Son of
Heaven. However, Hatsu had seen the back
of his horse&mdash;the modern Emperor rode thus
abroad, clear to the view of subjects less
humble than Hatsu, who dared to raise their
eyes to his supreme magnificence. Sunny
sighed. She felt sure that had she been in
Hatsu's place, she would at least have peeped
through her fingers at the mikado. Rummaging
among her treasures in the bamboo chest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
Sunny finally discovered what she sought&mdash;a
picture of the Emperor. This she laid before
her on the floor, and for a long, long time
she studied the features thoughtfully and
anxiously. After a while, she said with a sigh,
unconscious of the blasphemy, which caused
her maid to turn pale with horror,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not like his eye, and I do not like his
nose, and I do not like his mouth. Yet, Hatsusan,
it is the wish of Jerry-sama that I should
marry this Emperor, and now I must make
myself so beautiful that it will not hurt his eye
if he deigns to look at me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hatsu, at this moment was too overcome
with the utter audacity of the scheme to move,
and when she did find her voice, she said in a
breathless whisper:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mistress, the Son of Heaven already has a
wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; returned Sunny, with somewhat
of the careless manner toward sacred things
acquired from her friends, &quot;but perhaps he
may desire another one. Come, Hatsusan.
Work very hard on my face. Make me look
like ancient picture of an Empress of Japan.
See, here is a model!&quot; She offered one of her
mother's old prints, that revealed a court lady
in trailing gown and loosened hair, an uplifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
fan half revealing, half disclosing a weirdly
lovely face, as she turned to look at a tiny
dog frolicking on her train.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a long, a painful and arduous process,
this work of beautifying Sunny. There was
fractious hair to be darkened and smoothed,
and false hair to help out the illusion. There
was a small face that had to be almost completely
made over, silken robes from the
mother's chest to slip over the girlish shoulders,
shining nails to be polished and hidden behind
gold nail protectors, paint and paste to be
thickly applied, and a cape of a thousand
colours to be thrown over the voluminous many
coloured robes beneath.</p>

<p class="indent">The sky was a dazzling blaze of red and
gold. Even the deepening shadows were
touched with gilt, and the glory of that Japanese
sunset cast its reflection upon the book-lined
walls of the big living room, where the
Americans, lingering over pipe and hook,
dreamily and appreciatively watched the marvellous
spectacle through the widely opened
windows. But their siesta was strangely interrupted,
for, like a peacock, a strange vision
trailed suddenly into the room and stood with
suspended breath, fan half raised, in the manner
of a court lady of ancient days, awaiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
judgment. They did not know her at first.
This strange figure seemed to have stepped
out of some old Japanese print, and was as
far from being the little Sunny who had come
into their lives and added the last touch of
magic to their trip in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent">After the first shock, they recognised
Sunny. Her face was heavily plastered with
a white paste. A vivid splotch of red paint
adorned and accentuated either slightly high
cheek bone. Her eyebrows had disappeared
under a thick layer of paste, and in their place
appeared a brand new pair of intensely black
ones, incongruously laid about an inch above
the normal line and midway of her forehead.
Her lips were painted to a vivid point, star
shaped, so that the paint omitted the corners
of Sunny's mouth, where were the dimples
that were part of the charm of the Sunny they
knew. Upon the girl's head rested an amazing
ebony wig, one long lock of which trailed fantastically
down from her neck to the hem of
her robe. Shining daggers and pins, and artificial
flowers completed a head dress. She was
arrayed in an antique kimona, an article of
stiff and unlimited dimensions, under which
were seven other robes of the finest silk, each
signifying some special virtue. A train trailed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
behind Sunny that covered half the length of
the room. Her heavily embroidered outer robe
was a gift to her mother from a prince, and
its magnificence proclaimed its antiquity.</p>

<p class="indent">It may be truly said for Sunny that she indeed
achieved her own peculiar idea of what
constituted beauty, and as she swept the fan
from before her face with real art and grace
there was pardonable pride in her voice as she
said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honourable Mr. sirs, mebbe <i>now</i> you goin'
say I are beautifullest enough girl to make
those Emperor marry wiz me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A moment of tense silence, and then the
room resounded and echoed to the startled
mirth of the young barbarians. But no mirth
came from Sunny, and no mirth came from
Jerry. The girl stood in the middle of the
room, and through all her pride and dazzling
attire she showed how deeply they had
wounded her. A moment only she stayed, and
then tripping over her long train and dropping
her fan in her hurry, Sunny fled from the
room.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry said with an ominous glare at the
convulsed Bobs, Monty and even the aforesaid
melancholy Jinx:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was my fault. I told her art and time
would make her beautiful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The devil they would,&quot; snorted Bobs. &quot;I'd
like to know how you figured that art and time
could contribute to Sunny's natural beauty.
By George, she got herself up with the aid of
your damned art, to look like a valentine, if
you ask me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't agree with you,&quot; declared Jerry
hotly. &quot;It's all how one looks at such things.
It's a symptom of provincialism to narrow our
admiration to one type only. Such masters as
Whistler of our own land, and many of the
most famous artists of Europe have not hesitated
to take Japanese art as their model.
What Sunny accomplished was the reproduction
of a living work of art of the past, and it
is the crassest kind of ignorance to reward her
efforts with laughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry was almost savage in his denunciation
of his friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I agree with you,&quot; said Professor Barrowes
snapping his glasses back on his nose,
&quot;absolutely, absolutely. You are entirely
right, Mr. Hammond,&quot; and in turn he glared
upon his &quot;class&quot; as if daring anyone of them
to question his own opinion. Jinx indeed did
feebly say:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, for my part, give me Sunny as we
know her. Gosh! I don't see anything pretty
in all that dolled-up stuff and paint on her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, young gentleman,&quot; continued Professor
Barrowes, seizing the moment to deliver
a gratuitous lecture, &quot;there are certain cardinal
laws governing art and beauty. It is
not a matter of eyes, ears and noses, or even
the colour of the skin. It is how we are accustomed
to look at a thing. As an example, we
might take a picture. Seen from one angle,
it reveals a mass of chaotic colour that has no
excuse for being. Seen from another point,
the purpose of the artist is clearly delineated,
and we are trapped in the charm of his creation.
Every clime has its own peculiar estimate,
but it comes down each time to ourselves.
Poetically it has been beautifully expressed
as follows: 'Unless we carry the beautiful
with us, we will find it not.'  Ahem!&quot; Professor
Barrowes cleared his throat angrily, and
scowled, with Jerry, at their unappreciative
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Goto, salaaming deeply in the doorway, was
sonorously announcing honourable dinner for
the honourable sirs, and coming softly across
the hall, in her simple plum coloured kimona
with its golden obi, the paint washed from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
face, and showing it fresh and clean as a
baby's, Sunny's April smile was warming and
cheering them all again.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx voiced the sentiment of them all, including
the angry professor and beauty loving
Jerry:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh! give me Sunny just as she is, without
one plea.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER V</p>

<p class="indent">There comes a time in the lives of all
young men sojourning in foreign lands
when the powers that be across the water
summon them to return to the land of their
birth.</p>

<p class="indent">Years before, letters and cablegrams not unsimilar
to those that now poured in upon her
friends came persistently across the water to
the father of Sunny. Then there was no Professor
Barrowes to govern and lay down the
law to the infatuated man. He was able to
put off the departure for several years, but
with the passage of time the letters that admonished
and threatened not only ceased to
come, but the necessary remittances stopped
also. Sunny's father found himself in the
novel position of being what he termed &quot;broke&quot;
in a strange land.</p>

<p class="indent">As in the case of Jerry Hammond, whose
people were all in trade, there was a strange
vein of sentiment in the father of Sunny. To
his people indeed, he appeared to be one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
those freaks of nature that sometimes appear
in the best regulated families, and deviate from
the proper paths followed by his forbears. He
had acquired a sentiment not merely for the
land, but for the woman he had taken as his
wife; above all, he was devoted to his little
girl. It is hard to judge of the man from
his subsequent conduct upon his return to
America. His marriage to the mother of
Sunny had been more or less of a mercenary
transaction. She had been sold to the American
by a stepfather anxious to rid himself of
a child who showed the clear evidence of her
white father, and greedy to avail himself of
the terms offered by the American. It was, in
fact, a gay union into which the rich, fast
young man thoughtlessly entered, with a cynical
disregard of anything but his own desires.
The result was to breed in him at the outset a
feeling that he would not have analysed as
contempt, but was at all events scepticism for
the seeming love of his wife for him.</p>

<p class="indent">It was different with his child. His affection
for her was a beautiful thing. No shadow
of doubt or criticism came to mar the love that
existed between father and child. True,
Sunny was the product of a temporary union,
a ceremony of the teacup, which nevertheless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
is a legal marriage in Japan, and so regarded
by the Japanese. Lightly as the American
may have regarded his union with her mother,
he looked upon the child as legally and fully
his own, and was prepared to defend her
rights.</p>

<p class="indent">In America, making a clean breast to parents
and family lawyers, he assented to the
terms made by them, on condition that his
child at least should be obtained for him.
The determination to obtain possession of his
child became almost a monomania with the
man, and he took measures that were undeniably
ruthless to gratify his will. It may be
also that he was at this time the victim of
agents and interested parties. However, he
had lived in Japan long enough to know of
the proverbial frailty of the sex. The mercenary
motives he believed animated the
woman in marrying him, her inability to reveal
her emotions in the manner of the women
of his own race; her seeming indifference and
coldness at parting, which indeed was part of
her spartan heritage to face dire trouble unblenching&mdash;the
sort of thing which causes
Japanese women to send their warrior husbands
into battle with smiles upon their lips&mdash;all
these things contributed to beat the man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
into a mood of acquiescence to the demands of
his parents. He deluded himself into believing
that his Japanese wife, like her dolls, was
incapable of any intense feeling.</p>

<p class="indent">In due time, the machinery of law, which
works for those who pay, with miraculous
swiftness in Japan, was set into motion, and
the frail bonds that so lightly bound the
American to his Japanese wife, were severed.
At this time the mother of Sunny had been
plastic and apparently complacent, though rejecting
the compensation proffered her by her
husband's agents. The woman, who was later
to be known as Madame Many Smiles, turned
cold as death, however, when the disposition
of her child was broached. Nevertheless her
smiling mask betrayed no trace to the American
agents of the anguished turmoil within.
Indeed her amiability aroused indignant and
disgusted comment, and she was pronounced
a soulless butterfly. This diagnosis of the
woman was to be rudely shattered, when, beguiled
by her seeming indifference, they
relaxed somewhat of their vigilant espionage
of her, and awoke one morning to find that the
butterfly had flown beyond their reach.</p>

<p class="indent">The road of the mendicant, hunger, cold,
and even shame were nearer to the gates of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
Nirvanna than life in splendour without her
child. That was all part of the story of
Madame Many Smiles.</p>

<p class="indent">History, in a measure, was to repeat itself
in the life of Sunny. She had come to depend
for her happiness upon her friends, and the
shock of their impending departure was almost
more than she could bear.</p>

<p class="indent">She spent many hours kneeling before
Kuonnon, the Goddess of Mercy, throwing her
petitions upon the lap of the goddess, and
bruising her brow at the stone feet. It is sad
to relate of Sunny, who so avidly had embraced
the Christian faith, and was to the
proud Mr. Sutherland an example of his
labours in Japan, that in the hour of her great
trouble she should turn to a heathen goddess.
Yet here was Sunny, bumping her head at the
stone feet. What could the Three-in-one
God of the Reverend Mr. Sutherland do for
her now? Sunny had never seen his face; but
she knew well the benevolent comprehending
smile of the Goddess of Mercy, and in Her,
Sunny placed her trust. And so:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, divine Kuonnon, lovely Lady of
Mercy, hear my petition. Do not permit my
friends to leave Japan. Paralyse their feet.
Blind their eyes that they may not see the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
Pray you close up the west ocean, so no ships
may take my friends across. Hold them magnetised
to the honourable earth of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sitting back on her heels, having voiced her
petition anxiously she scanned the face of the
lady above her. The candles flickered and
wavered in the soft wind, and the incense
curled in a spiral cloud and wound in rings
about the head of the celestial one. Sunny
held her two hands out pleadingly toward the
unmoving face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lovely Kuonnon, it is true that I have
tried magic to keep my friends with me, but
even the oni (goblins) do not hear me, and my
friends' boxes stand now in the ozashiki and
the cruel carts carry them through the streets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice rose breathlessly, and she leaned
up and stared with wide eyes at the still face
above her, with its everlasting smile, and its
lips that never moved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is true! It is true!&quot; cried Sunny excitedly.
&quot;The mission sir is right. There is
no living heart in your breast. You are only
stone. You cannot even hear my prayer.
How then will you answer it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Half appalled by her own blasphemy, she
shivered away from the goddess, casting terrified
glances about her, and still sobbing in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
gasping way, Sunny covered her face with her
sleeve, and wended her way from the shrine
to her home.</p>

<p class="indent">Here the dishevelled upset of the house
brought home to her the unalterable fact of
their certain going. Restraint and gloom had
been in the once so jolly house, ever since Professor
Barrowes had announced the time of
departure. To the excited imagination of
Sunny it seemed that her friends sought to
avoid her. She could not understand that this
was because they found it difficult to face the
genuine suffering that their going caused their
little friend. Sunny at the door of the living
room sought fiercely to dissemble her grief.
Never would she reveal uncouth and uncivilised
tears; yet the smile she forced to her face
now was more tragic than tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx was alone in the room. The fat young
man was in an especially gloomy and melancholy
mood. He was wracking his brain for
some solution to the problem of Sunny. To
him, Sunny went directly, seating herself on
the floor in front of him, so that he was obliged
to look at the imploring young face, and had
much ado to control the lump that would rise
in Jinx's remorseful throat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx,&quot; said Sunny persuasively, &quot;I do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
like to stay ad this Japan all alone also. I lig'
you stay wiz me. Pray you do so, Mr. dear
Jinx!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh! I only wish I could, Sunny,&quot;
groaned Jinx, sick with sympathy, &quot;but, I
can't do it. It's impossible. I'm not&mdash;not my
own master yet. I did the best I could for
you&mdash;wrote home and asked my folks if&mdash;if I
could bring you along. Doggone them, anyway,
they've kept the wires hot ever since
squalling for me to get back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do nod lig' Japanese girl?&quot; asked
Sunny sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh, what do they know about it? I do,
anyway. I think you're a peachy kid, Sunny.
You suit me down to the ground, I'll tell the
world, and you look-a-here, I'm coming back
to see you, d'ye understand? I give you my
solemn word I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx,&quot; said Sunny, without a touch of hope
in her voice, &quot;my father are say same thing;
but&mdash;he never come bag no more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monty and Bobs, their arms loaded with
sundry boxes of sweets and pretty things that
aforetime would have charmed Sunny, came in
from the street just then, and with affected
cheer laid their gifts enticingly before the unbeguiled
Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;See here, kiddy. Isn't this pretty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs was swinging a long chain of bright
red and green beads. Not so long before
Sunny had led Bobs to that same string of
beads, which adorned the counter of a dealer
in Japanese jewelry, and had expressed to
him her ambition to possess so marvellous a
treasure. Bobs would have bought the ornament
then and there; but it so happened that
his finances were at their lowest ebb, his investment
in the Syndicate having made a
heavy inroad into the funds of the by no means
affluent Bobs. The wherewithal to purchase
the beads on the eve of departure had in fact
come from some obscure corner of his resources,
and he now dangled them enticingly
before the girl's cold eyes. She turned a shoulder
expressive of aversion toward the chain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do nod lig' those kind beads,&quot; declared
Sunny bitterly. Then upon an impulse, she
removed herself from her place before Jinx,
and kneeled in turn before Bobs, concentrating
her full look of appeal upon that palpably
moved individual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. sir&mdash;Bobs, I do nod lig' to stay ad
Japan, wizout you stay also. Please you take
me ad America wiz you. I are not afraid those
west oceans. I lig' those water. It is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
sad for me ad Japan. I do nod lig' Japan. She
is not Clistian country. Very bad people live
on Japan. I lig' go ad America. Please you
take me wiz you to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monty, hovering behind Bobs, was scowling
through his bone-ribbed glasses. Through his
seventeen-year-old brain raced wild schemes of
smuggling Sunny aboard the vessel; of choking
the watchful professor; of penning defiant
epistles to the home folks; of finding employment
in Japan and remaining firmly on these
shores to take care of poor little Sunny. The
propitiating words of Bobs appeared to Monty
the sheerest drivel, untrue slush that it was an
outrage to hand to a girl who trusted and believed.</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs was explaining that he was the beggar
of the party. When he returned to America,
he would have to get out and scuffle for a living,
for his parents were not rich, and it was
only through considerable sacrifice, and Bobs'
own efforts at work (he had worked his way
through college, he told Sunny) that he was
able to be one of the party of students who
following their senior year at college were
travelling for a year prior to settling down at
their respective careers. Bobs was too chivalrous
to mention to Sunny the fact that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
contribution to the Sunny Syndicate had
caused such a shrinkage in his funds that it
would take many months of hard work to make
up the deficit; nor that he had even become
indebted to the affluent Jinx in Sunny's behalf.
What he did explain was the fact that he expected
soon after he reached America, to land
a job of a kind&mdash;he was to do newspaper work&mdash;and
just as soon as ever he could afford it,
he promised to send for Sunny, who was more
than welcome to share whatever two-by-four
home Bobs may have acquired by that time.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny heard and understood little enough
of his explanation. All she comprehended
was that her request had been denied. Her
own father's defective promises had made her
forever sceptical of those of any other man in
the world. Jinx in morose silence pulled
fiercely on his pipe, brooding over the ill luck
that dogged a fellow who was fat as a movie
comedian and was related to an army of fat-heads
who had the power to order him to come
and go at their will. Jinx thought vengefully
and ominously of his impending freedom. He
would be of age in three months. Into his own
hands then, triumphantly gloated Jinx, would
fall the fortune of the house of Crawford, and
<i>then</i> his folks would see! He'd show 'em!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
And as for Sunny&mdash;well, Jinx was going to
demonstrate to that little girl what a man of
his word was capable of doing.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, having left Bobs, was giving her
full attention to Monty, who showed signs of
panic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty, I wan' go wiz you ad America.
<i>Please</i> take me there wiz you. I nod make no
trobble for you. I be bes' nize girl you ever
goin' see those worl. Please take me, Monty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aw&mdash;all right, I will. You bet your life I
will. That's settled, and you can count on me.
<i>I'm</i> not afraid of <i>my</i> folks, if the other fellows
are of theirs. I can do as I choose. I'll rustle
up the money somehow. There's always a
way, and they can say what they like at home,
I intend to do things in my own way. My
governor's threatening to cut me off; all the
fellows' parents are&mdash;they're in league together,
I believe, but I'm going to teach them
all a lesson. I'll not stir a foot from Japan
without you, Sunny. You can put that in
your pipe and swallow it. <i>I</i> mean every last
word <i>I</i> say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, now, now&mdash;not so hasty, young man,
not so hasty! Not so free with promises you
are unable to fulfil. Less words! Less words!
More deeds!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes, pausing on the threshold,
had allowed the junior member of the
party he was piloting through Japan to finish
his fiery tirade. He hung up his helmet, removed
his rubbers, and rubbing his chilled
hands to bring back the departed warmth,
came into the room and laid the mail upon the
table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here you are, gentlemen. American mail.
Help yourselves. All right, all right. Now,
if agreeable, I desire to have a talk alone with
Miss Sunny. If you young gentlemen will
proceed with the rest of your preparations I
daresay we will be on time. That will do,
Goto. That baggage goes with us. Loose
stuff for the steamer. Clear out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, alone with the professor, made her
last appeal.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kind Mr. Professor, please do not leave me
ad those Japan. I wan go ad America wiz
you. Please you permit me go also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes leaned over, held out
both his hands, and as the girl came with a
sob to him, he took her gently into his arms.
She buried her face on the shabby coat of the
old professor who had been such a good friend
to her, and who with all his eccentricities had
been so curiously loveable and approachable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
After she had cried a bit against the old coat,
Sunny sat back on her heels again, her two
hands resting on the professor's knees and covered
with one of his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, poor child, I know how hard it is
for you; but we are doing the best we can. I
want you to try and resign yourself to what is
after all inevitable. I have arranged for you
to go to the Sutherlands' home. You know
them both&mdash;good people, Sunny, good people,
in spite of their pious noise. Mr. Blumenthal
has charge of your financial matters. You are
amply provided for, thanks to the generosity
of your friends, and I may say we have done
everything in our power to properly protect
you. You are going to show your appreciation
by&mdash;er&mdash;being a good girl. Keep at your
studies. Heed the instructions of Mr. Sutherland.
He has your good at heart. I will not
question his methods. We all have our peculiarities
and beliefs. The training will do you
no harm&mdash;possibly do you much good. I wish
you always to remember that my interest in
your welfare will continue, and it will be a
pleasure to learn of your progress. When you
can do so, I want you to write a letter to me,
and tell me all about yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Professor, if I study mos' hard, mebbe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
I grow up to be American girl&mdash;jos same as
her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny put the question with touching earnestness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We-el, I am not prepared to offer the
American girl as an ideal model for you to
copy, my dear, but I take it you mean&mdash;er&mdash;that
education will graft upon you our western
civilisation, such as it is. It may do so. It
may. I will not promise on that score. My
mind is open. It has been done, no doubt.
Many girls of your race have&mdash;ah&mdash;assimilated
our own peculiar civilisation&mdash;or a veneer of
the same. You are yourself mainly of white
blood. Yes, yes, it is possible&mdash;quite probable
in fact, that if you set out to acquire western
ways, you will succeed in making yourself&mdash;er&mdash;like
the people you desire to copy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And suppose I grow up lig' civilised girl,
<i>then</i> I may live ad America?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing to prevent you, my dear. Nothing
to prevent you. It's a free country. Open
to all. You will find us your friends, happy&mdash;I
may say&mdash;overjoyed to see you again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time since she had learned the
news of their impending departure a faint
smile lighted up the girl's sad face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I stay ad Japan till I get&mdash;civil&mdash;ise.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She stood up, and for a moment looked
down in mournful farewell on the seamed face
of her friend. Her soft voice dropped to a
caress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sayonara, <i>mos</i> kindes' man ad Japan. I
goin' to ask all those million gods be good to
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Professor Barrowes did not even chide
her for her reference to the gods. He sat
glaring alone in the empty room, fiercely
rubbing his glasses, and rehearsing some extremely
cutting and sarcastic phrases which he
proposed to pen or speak to certain parents
across the water, whose low minds suspected
mud even upon a lily. His muttering reverie
was broken by the quiet voice of Jerry. He
had come out of the big window seat, where
he had been all of the afternoon, unnoticed by
the others.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Professor Barrowes,&quot; said Jerry Hammond,
&quot;if you have no objection, I would like
to take Sunny back with me to America.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes scowled up at his
favourite pupil.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do object, I do object. Emphatically.
Most emphatically. I do not propose to allow
you, or any of the young gentlemen entrusted
to my charge, to commit an act that may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
of the gravest consequences to your future
careers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my case, you need feel under no obligations
to my parents. I am of age as you
know, and as you also know, I purpose to go
my own way upon returning home. My father
asked me to wait till after this vacation before
definitely deciding upon my future. Well,
I've waited, and I'm more than ever determined
not to go into the shops. I've a bit of
money of my own&mdash;enough to give me a start,
and I purpose to follow out my own ideas.
Now as to Sunny. I found that kid. She's
my own, when it comes down to that. I practically
adopted her, and I'll be hanged if I'm
going to desert her, just because my father
and mother have some false ideas as to the
situation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leaving out your parents from consideration,
I am informed that an engagement exists
between you and a Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Falconer, I believe
the name is, daughter of your father's
partner, I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What difference does that make?&quot; demanded
Jerry, setting his chin stubbornly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can it be possible that you know human
nature so little then, that you do not appreciate
the feelings your fiance is apt to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
toward any young woman you choose to
adopt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Sunny's nothing but a child. It's
absurd to refer to her as a woman, and if Miss
Falconer broke with me for a little thing like
that, I'd take my medicine I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are prepared, then, to break an engagement
that has the most hearty approval of
your parents, because of a quixotic impulse
toward one you say is a child, but, young man,
I would have you reflect upon the consequences
to the child. Your kindness would
act as a boomerang upon Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What in the world do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean that Sunny is emphatically not a
child. She was fifteen years old the other
day. That is an exceedingly delicate period
in a girl's life. We must leave the bloom upon
the rose. It is a sensitive period in the life of
a girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A long silence, and then Jerry:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Right-oh! It's good-bye to Sunny!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned on his heel and strode out to the
hall. Professor Barrowes heard him calling
to the girl upstairs in the cheeriest tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi! up there, Sunny! Come on down, you
little rascal. Aren't you going to say bye-bye
to your best friend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Sunny came slowly down the stairs. At the
foot, in the shadows of the hall she looked up
at Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now remember,&quot; he rattled along with assumed
merriment, &quot;that when next we meet
I expect you to be the Empress of Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry,&quot; said Sunny, in a very little voice,
her small eerie face seeming to shine with some
light, as she looked steadily at him, &quot;I lig' ask
you one liddle bit favour before you go way
from these Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go to it. What is it, Sunny. Ask, and
thou shalt receive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny put one hand on either of Jerry's
arms, and her touch had a curiously electrical
effect upon him. In the pause that ensued he
found himself unable to remove his fascinated
gaze from her face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, I wan' ask you, will you please give
me those American&mdash;kiss&mdash;good-a-bye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A great wave of tingling emotions swept
over Jerry, blinding him to everything in the
world but that shining face so close to his own.
Sunny a child! Her age terrified him. He
drew back, laughing huskily. He hardly knew
himself what it was he was saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't want to, Sunny&mdash;I don't&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He broke away abruptly and, turning,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
rushed into the living room, seized his coat
and hat, and was out of the house in a flash.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes stared at the door
through which Jerry had made his hurried
exit. To his surprise, he heard Sunny in the
hall, laughing softly, strangely. To his
puzzled query as to why she laughed, she said
softly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry are afraid of me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Professor Barrowes, student of human
nature as he prided himself upon being, did
not know that Sunny had stepped suddenly
across the gap that separates a girl from a
woman, and had come into her full stature.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VI</p>

<p class="indent">Time and environment work miracles. It
is interesting to study the phases of emotion
that one passes through as he emerges
from youth into manhood. The exaggerated
expressions, the unalterable conclusions, the
tragic imaginings, the resolves, which he feels
nothing can shake, how sadly and ludicrously
and with what swiftness are they dissipated.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to pass that Sunny's friends across
the sea reached a period where they thought of
her vaguely only as a charming and amusing
episode of an idyllic summer in the Land of
the Rising Sun. Into the oblivion of the years,
farther and farther retreated the face of the
Sunny whose April smile and ingenuous ways
and lovely face had once so warmed and
charmed their young hearts.</p>

<p class="indent">New faces, new scenes, new loves, work and
the claims and habits that fasten upon one with
the years&mdash;these were the forces that engrossed
them. I will not say that she was altogether
forgotten in the new life, but at least she occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
but a tiny niche in their sentimental
recollections. There were times, when a reference
to Japan would call forth a murmur
of pleasureable reminiscences, and humorous
references to some remembered fantastic trick
or trait peculiar to the girl, as:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you remember when Sunny tried to
catch that nightingale by putting salt near a
place where she thought his tail might rest?
I had told her she could catch him by putting
salt on his tail, and the poor kid took me literally.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx chuckled tenderly over the memory.
In the first year after his return to America
Jinx had borne his little friend quite often in
mind, and had sent her several gifts, all of
which were gratefully acknowledged by the
Reverend Simon Sutherland.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will you ever forget&quot; (from Bobs) &quot;her
intense admiration for Monty's white skin?
She sat on the bank of the pool for nearly an
hour, with the unfortunate kid under water,
waiting for her to go away, while she waited
for him to come out, because she said she
wanted to see what a white body looked like
'wiz nothing but skin on for clothes.' I had
to drag her off by main force. Ha, ha! I'll
never forget her indignation, or her question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
whether Monty was 'ashamed his body.' The
public baths of Nagasaki, you know, were
social meeting places, and introductions under
or above water quite the rule.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose,&quot; said Jerry, pulling at his pipe
thoughtfully, &quot;we never will get the Japanese
point of view anent the question of morals.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the shape of their eyes. They see
things slant-wise,&quot; suggested Jinx brilliantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Sunny's eyes, as I recall them,&quot; protested
Bobs, &quot;were not slanting, and she had
their point of view. You'll recall how the
Proff had much ado to prevent her taking her
own quaint bath in our 'lake' in beauty unadorned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A burst of laughter broke forth here.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he now? He never told me anything
about that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn't tell me either, but I <i>heard</i> him. He
explained to Sunny in the most fatherly way
the whole question of morals from the day of
Adam down, and she got him so tangled up
and ashamed of himself that he didn't know
where he was at. However, as I recall it, he
must have won out in the contention, for you'll
recall how she voiced such scathing and contemptuous
criticism later on the public bathers
of Japan, whom she said were 'igrant and nod
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
god nize Americazan manner and wear dress
cover hees body ad those bath.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Sunny was a darling kid, take it from
me. Just as innocent and sweet as a new-born
babe.&quot; This was Jinx's sentimental contribution,
and no voice arose to question his verdict.</p>

<p class="indent">So it will be perceived that her friends, upon
the rare occasions when she was recalled to
memory, still held her in loving, if humorous
regard, and it was the custom of Jerry to end
the reminiscences of Sunny with a big sigh and
a dumping of the ash from his pipe, as he dismissed
the subject with:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, I suppose she's the Empress of
Japan by now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All of them were occupied with the concerns
and careers that were of paramount importance
to them. Monty, though but in his
twenty-first year, an Intern at Bellevue; Bobs,
star reporter on the <i>Comet</i>; Jinx, overwhelmingly
rich, the melancholy and unwilling
magnet of all aspiring mothers-in-law; Jerry,
an outlaw from the house of Hammond,
though his engagement to Miss Falconer bade
fair to reinstate him in his parents' affections.
He was doggedly following that star of which
he had once told Sunny. Eight hours per day
in an architect's office, and four or six hours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
in his own studio, was the sum of the work
of Jerry. He &quot;lived in the clouds,&quot; according
to his people; but all the great deeds of the
world, and all of the masterpieces penned or
painted by the hand of man, Jerry knew were
the creations of dreamers&mdash;the &quot;cloud livers.&quot;
So he took no umbrage at the taunt, and kept
on reaching after what he had once told Sunny
was that Jade of fortune&mdash;Beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">Somewhere up the State, Professor Barrowes
pursued the uneven tenor of his way as
Professor of Archeology and Zoology in a
small college. Impetuous and erratic, becoming
more restless with the years, he escaped
the irritations and demands of the class room
at beautiful intervals, when he indulged in a
passion of research that took him into the far
corners of the world, to burrow into the earth
in search of things belonging to the remote
dead and which he held of more interest than
mere living beings. His fortunes were always
uncertain, because of this eccentric weakness,
and often upon returning from some such
quest his friends had much ado to secure him
a berth that would serve as an immediate livelihood.
Such position secured, after considerable
wire pulling on the part of Jerry and
other friends, Professor Barrowes would be no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
sooner seated in the desired chair, when he
would begin to lay plans for another escape.
An intimate friendship existed between Jerry
and his old master, and it was to Jerry that
he invariably went upon his return from his
archeological quests. Despite the difference
in their years, there was a true kinship between
these two. Each comprehended the other's
aspirations, and in a way the passion for exploration
and the passion for beauty is
analogous. Jerry's parents looked askance at
this friendship, and were accustomed to blame
the Professor for their son's vagaries, believing
that he aided and abetted and encouraged
Jerry, which was true enough.</p>

<p class="indent">Of all Sunny's friends, Professor Barrowes,
alone, kept up an irregular communication
with the Sutherlands. Gratifying reports of
the progress of their protg came from the
missionary at such times. Long since, it had
been settled that Sunny should be trained to
become a shining example to her race&mdash;if, in
fact, the Japanese might be termed her race.
It was the ambition of the good missionary to
so instruct the girl that she would be competent
to step into the missionary work, and with
her knowledge of the Japanese tongue and
ways, her instructor felt assured they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
expect marvels from her in the matter of converting
the heathen.</p>

<p class="indent">It is true the thought of that vivid little
personality in the grey rle of a preacher,
brought somewhat wry faces to her friends,
and exclamations even of distaste.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh!&quot; groaned Jinx sadly, &quot;I'd as lieves
see her back on the tightrope.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Imagine Sunny preaching! It would be a
raving joke. I can just hear her twisting up
her eight million gods and goddesses with our
own deity,&quot; laughed Bobs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like quenching a firefly's light, or the
bruising of a butterfly's wings,&quot; murmured
Jerry, dreamily, his head encircled with rings
of smoke.</p>

<p class="indent">But then one becomes accustomed to even
a fantastic thought. We accredit certain
qualities and actions to individuals, and, in
time, in our imaginations at least, they assume
the traits with which we have invested them.
After all, it was very comforting to think of
that forlorn orphan child in the safe haven of
a mission school.</p>

<p class="indent">So the years ran on and on, as they do in
life, and as they do in stories such as this, and
it came to pass, as written above, that Sunny
disappeared into the fragrant corners of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
pretty memory. There is where Sunny should
perhaps have stayed, and thus my story come
to a timely end.</p>

<p class="indent">Consider the situation. A girl, mainly of
white blood, with just a drop of oriental blood
in her&mdash;enough to make her a bit different
from the average female of the species, enough,
say, to give a snack of that savage element
attributed to the benighted heathen. Rescued
by men of her father's race from slavery and
abuse; provided for for the rest of her days;
under the instruction of a zealous and conscientious
missionary and his wife, who earnestly
taught her how to save the souls of the
people of Japan. Sunny's fate was surely a
desirable one, and as she progressed on the
one side of the water, her friends on the other
side were growing in sundry directions, ever
outward and upward, acquiring new responsibilities,
new loves, new claims, new passions
with the passing of the years. What freak of
fate therefore should interpose at this juncture,
and thrust Sunny electrically into the
lives of her friends again?</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VII</p>

<p class="indent">On a certain bleak day in the month of
March, J. Addison Hammond, Jr.,
tenaciously at work upon certain plans and
drawings that were destined at a not far distant
date to bring him a measure of fame and
fortune, started impatiently from his seat and
cursed that &quot;gosh-ding-danged telephone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry at this stage of his picturesque career
occupied what is known in New York City,
and possibly other equally enlightened cities,
as a duplex studio. Called &quot;duplex&quot; for no
very clear reason. It consists of one very
large room (called &quot;atelier&quot; by artistic tenants
and those who have lived or wanted to live in
France). This room is notable not merely
for its size, but its height, the ceiling not unsimilar
to the vaulted one of a church, or a
glorified attic. Adjustable skylights lend the
desired light. About this main room, and midway
of the wall, is a gallery which runs on all
four sides, and on this gallery are doors opening
into sundry rooms designated as bedrooms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
The arrangement is an excellent one, since it
gives one practically two floors. That, no
doubt, is why we call it &quot;duplex.&quot; We have a
weakness for one floor bungalows when we
build houses these days, but for apartments
and studios the epicure demands the duplex.</p>

<p class="indent">In this especial duplex studio there also
abode one t, or as he was familiarly
known to the friends of Jerry Hammond,
&quot;Hatty.&quot; Hatty, then, was the valet and man
of all work in the employ of Jerry. He was
a marvellous cook, an extraordinary house
cleaner, an incomparable valet, and to complete
the perfections of this jewel, possessed
solely by the apparently fortunate Jerry, his
manners, his face and his form were of that
ideal sort seen only in fiction and never in life.
Nevertheless the incomparable Hatton, or
Hatty, was a visible fact in the life and studio
of Jerry Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">Having detailed the talents of Hatty, it is
painful here to admit a flaw in the character
of the otherwise perfect valet. This flaw he
had very honestly divulged to Jerry at the
time of entering his employ, and the understanding
was that upon such occasions when
said flaw was due to have its day, the master
was to forbear from undue criticism or from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
discharging said Hatton from his employ.
Hatton, at this time, earnestly assured the man
in whose employ he desired to enter, that he
could always depend upon his returning to
service in a perfectly normal state, and life
would resume its happy way under his competent
direction.</p>

<p class="indent">It so happened upon this especial night,
when that &quot;pestiferous&quot; telephone kept up its
everlasting ringing&mdash;a night when Jerry
hugged his head in his hands, calling profanely
and imploringly upon Christian and
heathen saints and gods to leave him undisturbed&mdash;that
Hatton lay on his bed above, in
a state of oblivion from which it would seem a
charge of dynamite could not have awakened
him.</p>

<p class="indent">For the fiftieth or possibly hundredth time
Jerry bitterly swore that he would fire that
&quot;damned Englishman&quot; (Hatton was English)
on the following day. He had had enough of
him. Whenever he especially needed quiet and
service, that was the time the &quot;damned
Englishman&quot; chose to break loose and go on
one of his infernal sprees. For the fourth
time within half an hour Jerry seized that telephone
and shouted into the receiver:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What in hades do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The response was a long and continuous
buzzing, through which a jabbering female
tongue screeched that it was Y. Dubaday talking.
It sounded like &quot;Y. Dubaday,&quot; but
Jerry knew no one of that name, and so emphatically
stated, adding to the fact that he
didn't know anyone of that name and didn't
want to, and if this was their idea of a
joke&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He hung up at this juncture, seized his head,
groaned, walked up and down swearing softly
and almost weeping with nervousness and distraction.
Finally with a sigh of hopelessness
as he realised the impossibility of concentrating
on that night, Jerry gathered up his tools
and pads, packed them into a portfolio, which
he craftily hid under a mass of papers&mdash;Jerry
knew where he could put his hands on any
desired one&mdash;got his pipe, pulled up before
the waning fire, gave it a shove, put on a fresh
log, lit his pipe, stretched out his long legs,
put his brown head back against the chair,
and sought what comfort there might be left
to an exasperated young aspirant for fame
who had been interrupted a dozen times inside
of an hour or so. Hardly had he settled down
into this comparative comfort when that telephone
rang again. Jerry was angry now&mdash;&quot;hopping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
mad.&quot; He lifted that receiver with
ominous gentleness, and his voice was silken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What can I do for you, fair one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Curiously enough the buzzing had completely
stopped and the fair one's reply came
vibrating clearly into his listening ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hammond?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Hammond, manager of some corporation
or company in Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you'll hold the wire long enough to take
a message from a friend I'll deliver it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Friend, eh? Who is he? I'd like to get a
look at him this moment. Take your time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I've no time to talk nonsense. This
is the Y. W. C. A. speaking, and there's a
young lady here, who says she&mdash;er&mdash;belongs
to you. She&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What? Say that again, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A young lady that appears to be related to
you&mdash;says you are her guardian or manager or
something of the sort. She was delivered to
the Y. by the Reverend Miss Miriam Richardson,
in whose care she was placed by the Mission
Society of&mdash;er&mdash;Naggysack, Japan. One
minute, I'll get her name again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A photograph of Jerry at this stage would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
have revealed a young man sitting at a telephone
desk, registering a conflict of feelings
and emotions indicative of consternation,
guilt, tenderness, fear, terror, compunction,
meanness and idiocy. When that official voice
came over the wire a second time, Jerry all but
collapsed against the table, holding the receiver
uncertainly in the direction of that ear
that still heard the incredible news and confirmed
his fears:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Name&mdash;Miss Sindicutt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Silence, during which the other end apparently
heard not that exclamation of desperation:
&quot;Ye gods and little fishes!&quot; for it resumed
complacently:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall we send her up to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, for heaven's sake don't. That is,
wait a bit, will you? Give me a chance to get
over the&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Jerry was about to say &quot;shock,&quot;
but stopped himself in time and with as much
composure as he could muster he told the
Y. W. C. A. that he was busy just now, but
would call later, and advise them what to do
in the&mdash;under his breath he said &quot;appalling&quot;&mdash;circumstances.</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly Jerry put the receiver back on the
hook. He remained in the chair like one who
has received a galvanic shock. That Japanese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
girl, of a preposterous dream, had actually followed
him to America! She was here&mdash;right
in New York City. It was fantastic, impossible!
Ha, ha! it would be funny, if it were
not so danged impossible. In the United
States, of all places! She, who ought to be
right among her heathens, making good converts.
What in the name of common sense had
she come to the States for? Why couldn't
she let Jerry alone, when he was up to his neck
in plans that he fairly knew were going to
create an upheaval in the architectural world?
Just because he had befriended her in his infernal
youth, he could not be expected to be
responsible for her for the rest of her days.
Besides, he, Jerry, was not the only one in that
comic opera Syndicate. The thought of his
partners in crime, as they now seemed to him,
brought him up again before that telephone,
seizing upon it this time as a last straw.</p>

<p class="indent">He was fortunate to get in touch with all
three of the members of the former Sunny
Syndicate Limited. While Monty and Bobs
rushed over immediately, Jinx escaped from
the Appawamis Golf Club where for weeks he
had been vainly trying to get rid of some of
his superfluous flesh by chasing little red balls
over the still snow bound course, flung himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
into his powerful Rolls Royce, and went
speeding along the Boston Post Road at a
rate that caused an alarm to be sent out for
him from point to point. Not swift enough,
however, to keep up with the fat man in the
massive car that &quot;made the grade&quot; to New
York inside of an hour, and rushed like a juggernaut
over the slick roads and the asphalt
pavements of Manhattan.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry's summons to his college friends had
been in the nature of an S. O. S. call for help.
On the telephone he vouchsafed merely the information
that it was &quot;a deadly matter of life
and death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The astounding news he flung like a bomb
at each hastily arriving member of the late
Syndicate. When the first excitement had
subsided, the paramount feeling was one of
consternation and alarm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh!&quot; groaned Jinx, &quot;what in the name
of thunderation are you going to do with a
Japanese girl in New York City? I pity you,
Jerry, for of course you are mainly responsible&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Responsible nothing&mdash;&mdash;&quot; from the indignant
Jerry, wheeling about with a threatening
look at that big &quot;fathead.&quot; &quot;I presume I was
the <i>only</i> member of that&mdash;er&mdash;syndicate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;At least it was your idea,&quot; said Monty, extremely
anxious to get back to the hospital,
where he had been personally supervising a
case of Circocele.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might have known,&quot; suggested Bobs,
&quot;that she was bound to turn out a Frankenstein.
Of course, we'll all stand by you, old
scout, but you know how I am personally situated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry's wrathful glare embraced the circle
of his renegade friends.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're a fine bunch of snobs. I'm not
stuck myself on having a Jap girl foisted on
to my hands, and there'll be a mess of explanations
to my friends and people, and the Lord
only knows how I'll ever be able to put my
mind back on my work and&mdash;&mdash; At the same
time, I'm not so white livered that I'm going
to flunk the responsibility. We encouraged&mdash;invited
her to join us out here. I did. You
did, so did you, and you! I heard you all&mdash;every
last one of you, and you can't deny it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it was one thing to sentimentalise
over a pretty little Jap in Japan,&quot; growled
Bobs, who was not a snob, but in spite of his
profession at heart something of a stickler
for the conventions, &quot;but it's another proposition
here. Of course, as I said, we fellows all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
intend to stand by you.&quot; (Grunts of unwilling
assent from Monty and Jinx.) &quot;We aren't
going to welch on our part of the job, and
right here we may as well plan out some
scheme to work this thing properly. Suppose
we make the most of the matter for the present.
We'll keep her down there at that 'Y.'
Do you see? Then, we can each do something
to&mdash;er&mdash;make it&mdash;well uncomfortable for her
here. We'll freeze her out if it comes down to
that. Make her feel that this U. S. A. isn't
all it's cracked up to be, and she'll get home-sick
for her gods and goddesses and at the psychological
moment when she's feeling her
worst, why we'll just slip her aboard ship,
and there you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Great mind! Marvellous intellect you got,
Bobs. In the first place, the 'Y' informed
me on the 'phone that they are sending her
here. They are waiting now for me to give the
word when to despatch her, in fact. Now the
question is&quot;&mdash;Jerry looked sternly at his
friends&mdash;&quot;which one of your families would be
decent enough to give a temporary home to
Sunny? My folks as you know are out of the
reckoning, as I'm an outlaw from there myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Followed a heated argument and explanations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
Monty's people lived in Philadelphia.
He himself abode at the Bellevue Hospital.
That, so he said, let him out. Not at all, from
Jerry's point of view. Philadelphia, said
Jerry, was only a stone's throw from New
York. Monty, exasperated, retorted that he
didn't propose to throw stones at his folks.
Monty, who had made such warm promises to
Sunny!</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs shared a five-room bachelor flat with
two other newspaper men. Their hours were
uncertain, and their actions erratic. Often
they played poker till the small hours of the
morning. Sunny would not fit into the atmosphere
of smoke and disorder, though she was
welcome to come, if she could stand the
&quot;gaff.&quot; Bobs' people lived in Virginia. His
several sisters, Bobs was amusedly assured,
would hardly put the girl from Japan at her
ease.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx, on whom Jerry now pinned a hopeful
eye, blustered shamelessly, as he tried to explain
his uncomfortable position in the world.
When not at his club in New York, he lived
with a sister, Mrs. Vanderlump, and her growing
family in the Crawford mansion at Newport.
Said sister dominated this palatial abode
and brother Jinx escaped to New York upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
occasions in a true Jiggsian manner, using
craft and ingenuity always to escape the vigilant
eye and flaying tongue of a sister who
looked for the worst and found it. It was hard
for Jinx to admit to his friends that he was
horribly henpecked, but he appealed to them as
follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a heart about this thing. I ask you,
what is a fellow to do when he's got a sister
on his back like that? If she suspects every
little innocent chorus girl of the town, what
is she going to say to Sunny when that kid
goes up before her in tights?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is extraordinary how we think of people
we have not seen in years as they were when
first we saw them. In the heat of argument,
no one troubled to point out to Jinx that the
Sunny who had come upon the tight rope that
first night must have long since graduated
from that reprehensible type of dress or rather
undress.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, and as a last resort, a night letter
was despatched to Professor Timothy Barrowes.
All were now agreed that he was the
one most competent to settle the matter of
the disposition of Sunny, and all agreed to
abide by his decision.</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture, and when a sense of satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
in having &quot;passed the buck&quot; to the competent
man of archology had temporarily
cheered them, a tapping was heard upon the
studio door. Not the thumping of the goblin's
head of the Italian iron knocker; not the shriek
of the electric buzzer from the desk below,
warning of the approach of a visitor. Just a
soft taptapping upon the door, repeated several
times, as no one answered, and increasing
in noise and persistence.</p>

<p class="indent">A long, a silent, a deadly pause ensued. At
that moment each found himself attributing
to that girl they had known in Japan, and
whom they realised was on the other side of
that door, certain characteristic traits and
peculiarities charming enough in Japan but
impossible to think of as in America. To each
young man there came a mental picture of a
bizarre and curious little figure, adorned with
blazingly bright kimona and obi&mdash;a brilliant
patch of colour, her bobbed hair and straight
bangs seeming somehow incongruous and adding
to her fantastic appearance. After all, in
spite of her hair, she was typical of that land
of crooked streets, and paper houses, and people
who walked on the wrong side and mounted
their horses from the front. The thought of
that girl in New York City grated against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
their sensibilities. She didn't belong and she
never could belong was their internal verdict.</p>

<p class="indent">It may have been only a coincidence, but it
seemed weird, that Hatton, lately so dead to
the world, should appear at that psychological
moment on the steps of the gallery, immaculate
in dress and with that cool air of superiority
and efficiency that was part of his assets,
descend in his stately and perfect way, approach
the door as a butler should, and softly,
imperturbably fling that door open. His back
retained its stiff straight line, that went so
well with the uniform Hatton insisted upon
donning, but his head went sideways forward
in that inimitable bow that Hatton always reserved
for anything especially attractive in
the female line.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the threshold there looked back at
Hatton, and then beyond him, a girl whom the
startled young men took at first to be a perfect
stranger. She wore a plain blue serge suit,
belted at the waist, with a white collar and
jabot. A sailor hat, slightly rolled, crushed
down the hair that still shone above the face
whose remarkable beauty owed much to a certain
quaintness of expression. She stood silently,
without moving, for what seemed a long
moment to them all, and then suddenly she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
spoke, breathlessly and with that little catch
in her voice, and her tone, her look, her words,
her quick motions so characteristic of the little
girl they had known, broke the spell of silence
and let loose a flood of such warm memories
that all the mean and harsh and contemptible
thoughts of but a moment since were dissipated
forever.</p>

<p class="indent">They crowded about her, hanging upon and
hungry for her unabashed and delighted
words, and dazzled by the girl's uncanny loveliness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx! Thad are you! I know you by your
so nize fat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had not lost her adorable accent. Indeed,
if they could but have realised it, Sunny
had changed not at all. She had simply
grown up.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx's soft hands were holding the two little
fragrant ones thrust so joyously into his
own. The fat fellow fought a sudden maddening
desire to hug like a bear the girl whose
bright eyes were searching his own so lovingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty! Oh, you have grow into whole
mans. <i>How</i> it is nize. And you still smile on
me troo those glass ad you eye.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Smile! Monty was grinning like the proverbial
Cheshire cat. That case of Circocele
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
at Bellevue hospital had vanished into the dim
regions of young Monty's mind. Anyway
there were a score of other Internes there, and
Monty had his permit in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobs! Is thad youself, wiz those fonny
liddle hair grow om your mout'. <i>How</i> it is
grow nize on you face. I lig' him there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Any doubt that Bobs had experienced as to
the desirability of that incipient moustache
vanished then and there.</p>

<p class="indent">And Jerry! Jerry, for the last, to be
looked at with shining eyes, till something
tightened in his throat, and his mind leaped
over the years and felt again that dizzy, tingling,
electrical sensation when Sunny had
asked him to kiss her.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VIII</p>

<p class="indent">That &quot;even tenor of their ways,&quot; to
which reference has already been made,
ceased indeed to bear a remote resemblance to
evenness. It may be recorded here, that for one
of them at least, Sunny's coming meant the
hasty despatch of his peace of mind. Their
well laid schemes to be rid of her seemed now
in the face of their actions like absurd aberrations
that they were heartily ashamed of.</p>

<p class="indent">It is astonishing how we are affected by
mere clothes. Perhaps if Sunny had appeared
at the door of Jerry Hammond's studio arrayed
in the shining garments of a Japanese,
some measure of their alarm might have remained.
But she came to their door as an
American girl. That Sunny should have stood
the test of American clothes, that she shone in
them with a distinction and grace that was all
her own, was a matter of extreme pride and
delight to her infatuated friends. Appearances
play a great part in the imagination and
thought of the young American. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
fantastic conception they had formed of her,
and the imagined effect of her strange appearance
in America that had filled them with misgiving
and alarm&mdash;the sneeky sort of apprehension
one feels at being made conspicuous
and ridiculous. There was an immense relief
at the discovery that their fears were entirely
unfounded. Sunny appeared a finished product
in the art of dressing. Not that she was
fashionably dressed. She simply had achieved
the look of one who belonged. She was as
natural in her clothes as any of their sisters or
the girls they knew. There was this difference,
however: Sunny was one of those rare beings
of earth upon whom the Goddess of Beauty
has ineffaceably laid her hands. Her loveliness,
in fact, startled one with its rareness, its
crystal delicacy. One looked at the girl's face,
and caught his breath and turned to look again,
with that pang of longing that is almost pain
when we gaze upon a masterpiece.</p>

<p class="indent">Yet &quot;under the skin&quot; she was the same confiding,
appealing, mischievous little Sunny
who had pushed her way into the hearts of her
friends.</p>

<p class="indent">Her mission in America, much as it aroused
the mirth of her friends, was a very serious one,
and it may be here stated, later, an eminently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
successful one. Sunny came as an emissary
from the mission school to collect funds for
the impoverished mission. Mr. Sutherland, a
Scotchman by birth, was not without a canny
and shrewd streak to his character, and he had
not forgotten the generous contributions in
the past of the rich young Americans whose
protg Sunny had been.</p>

<p class="indent">All this, however, does not concern the devastating
effect of her presence in the studio of
Jerry Hammond. There, in fact, Sunny had
taken up an apparently permanent residence,
settling down as a matter of course and right,
and indeed assisted by the confused and alternately
dazed and beguiled Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">Her effects consisted of a bag so small, and
containing but a few articles of Japanese silk
clothing and a tiny gift for each of her dear
friends. Indeed, the smallness of Sunny's luggage
appealed instantly to her friends, who
determined to purchase for her all the pretty
clothes her heart should desire. This ambition
to deck Sunny in the fine raiment of New York
City was satisfactorily realised by each and
everyone of the former Syndicate, Sunny accompanying
them with alacrity, overjoyed by
those delicious shopping tours, the results of
which returned in Jinx's Rolls Royce, Monty's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
taxi, Bobs' messenger boys, and borne by hand
by Jerry. These articles, however, became
such a bone of contention among her friends,
each desiring her to wear his especial choice,
that Sunny had her hands full pleasing them
all. She compromised by wearing a dress donated
by Monty, hat from Jinx, a coat from
Jerry, and stockings and gloves from Bobs.
It was finally agreed by her friends that there
should be a cessation to the buying of further
clothes for Sunny. Instead an allowance of
money was voted and quickly subscribed to by
all, and after that, Sunny, with the fatherly
aid of a surprisingly new Hatton, did her own
purchasing.</p>

<p class="indent">Of her four friends, Jerry was possibly the
happiest and the unhappiest at this time. He
was a prey to both exhilaration and panic.
He moved heaven and earth to make Sunny so
comfortable and contented in his studio, that
all thought of returning to Japan would be
banished forever from her mind. On the other
hand, he rushed off, panic stricken and sent
telegrams to Professor Barrowes, entreating
him to come at once and relieve Jerry of his
dangerous charge. His telegrams, however,
were unfruitful, for after an aggravating
delay, during which Sunny became, like Hatton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
one of the habits and necessities of Jerry's
life, the Telegraph Company notified him that
Professor Barrowes was no longer at that particular
school of learning, and that his address
there was unknown. Jerry, driven to extremities
by the situation in his studio, made himself
such a nuisance to the Telegraph Company,
that they bestirred themselves finally and ascertained
that the last address of Professor
Timothy Barrowes was Red Deer, Alberta,
Canada. Now Red Deer represented nothing
to Jerry Hammond save a town in Canada
where a wire would reach his friend. Accordingly
he despatched the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Professor Timothy Barrowes,<br/>
Red Deer, Alberta, Canada.</p>

<p class="indent">Come at once. Sunny in New York. Need you take
her charge. Delay dangerous. Waiting for you. Come
at once. Answer at once. Important.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. Addison Hammond.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes received this frantic
wire while sitting on a rock very close to the
edge of a deep excavation that had recently
been dug on the side of a cliff towering above a
certain portion of the old Red Deer River.
Below, on a plateau, a gang of men were digging
and scraping and hammering at the cliff.
Not in the manner of the husky workers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
northwestern Canada, but carefully, tenderly.
Not so carefully, however, but the tongue of
the Professor on the rock above castigated
and nagged and warned. Ever and anon
Sunny's old friend would leap down into the
excavation, and himself assist the work physically.</p>

<p class="indent">As stated, Jerry's telegram came to his
hand while seated upon aforesaid rock, was
opened, and absent-mindedly scanned by
Jerry's dear friend, and then thrust hastily
into the professor's vest pocket, there to remain
for several days, when it accidentally was
resurrected, and he most thoughtfully despatched
a reply, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><br/>Jeremy Addison Hammond,<br/>
12 West 67th St.,<br/>
New York City, U. S. A.</p>

<p>Collect.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="indent">What Jerry said when he tore open and
read that long expected telegram would not
bear printing. Suffice it to say that his good
old friend was consigned by the wrathful and
disgusted Jerry to a warmer region than
Mother Earth. Then, squaring his shoulders
like a man, and setting his chin grimly, Jerry
took up the burden of life, which in these latter
days had assumed for him such bewildering
proportions.</p>

<p class="indent">That she was an amazing, actual part of his
daily life seemed to him incredible, and beguiling
and fascinating as life now seemed to him
with her, and wretched and uncertain as it was
away from her, his alarm increased with every
day and hour of her abode in his house. He
assured himself repeatedly that there was no
more harm in Sunny living in his apartment
than there was in her living in his house in
Japan. What enraged the befuddled Jerry
at this time was the officious attitude of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
friends. Monty took it upon himself to go
room hunting for a place for Sunny, and
talked a good deal about the results he expected
from a letter written to Philadelphia.
He did not refer to Sunny now as a stone.
Monty was sure that the place for Sunny was
right in that Philadelphia home, presided over
by his doting parents and little brothers and
sisters, and where it was quite accessible for
week-end visits.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx, after a stormy scene with his elder sister
in which he endeavoured to force Sunny
upon the indignant and suspicious Mrs. Vanderlump,
left in high dudgeon the Newport
home in which he had been born, and which was
his own personal inheritance, and with threats
never to speak to his sister again, he took up
his residence at his club, just two blocks from
the 67th Street studio.</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs cleared out two of his friends from the
flat, bought some cretonne curtains with outrageous
roses and patches of yellow, purple,
red and green, hung these in dining room and
bedroom and parlour, bought a brand new victrola
and some quite gorgeous Chinese rugs,
and had a woman in cleaning for nearly a
week. To his friends' gibes and suggestions
that he apparently contemplated matrimony,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
Bobs sentimentally rejoined that sooner or
later a fellow got tired of the dingy life of a
smoke-and-card-filled flat and wanted a bit of
real sweetness to take away the curse of life.
He acquired two lots somewhere on Long
Island and spent considerable time consulting
an architect, shamefully ignoring Jerry's
gifts in that line.</p>

<p class="indent">That his friends, who had so savagely protested
again sharing the burden of Sunny,
should now try to go behind his back and take
her away from him was in the opinion of
Jerry a clue to the kind of characters they possessed,
and of which hitherto he had no slightest
suspicion.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry, at this time, resembled the proverbial
dog in the manger. He did not want Sunny
himself&mdash;that is, he dared not want Sunny&mdash;but
the thought of her going to any other place
filled him with anguish and resentment.
Nevertheless he realised the impossibility of
maintaining her much longer in his studio.
Already her presence there had excited gossip
and speculation in the studio building, but in
that careless and bohemian atmosphere with
which denizens of the art world choose to surround
themselves the lovely young stranger
in the studio of Jerry Hammond aroused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
merely smiling and indulgent curiosity. Occasionally
a crude joke or inquiry from a
neighbouring artist aroused murder in the soul
of the otherwise civilised Jerry. That anyone
could imagine anything wrong with Sunny
seemed to him beyond belief.</p>

<p class="indent">Not that he felt always kindly toward
Sunny. She aroused his ire more often than
she did his approval. She was altogether too
free and unconventional, in the opinion of
Jerry, and in a clumsy way he tried to teach
her certain rules of deportment for a young
woman living in the U. S. A. Sunny, however,
was so innocent and so evidently earnest
in her efforts to please him, that he invariably
felt ashamed and accused himself of being a
pig and a brute. Jerry was, indeed, like the
unfortunate boatman, drifting toward the
rocks, and seeing only the golden hair of the
Lorelei.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny had settled down so neatly and completely
in his studio that it would have been
hard to know how she was ever to be dislodged.
Her satisfaction and delight and surprise at
every object upon the place was a source of
immense satisfaction and entertainment to
Jerry. It should be mentioned here, that an
unbelievable change could have been observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
also in Hatton. The man was discovered to be
human. His face cracked up in smiles that
were real, and clucks that bore a remote
resemblance to human laughter issued at intervals
from the direction of the kitchen,
whither he very often hastily departed, his
hand over mouth, after some remark or action
of Sunny that appeared to smite his funny
bone.</p>

<p class="indent">The buttons on the wall were a never failing
source of enchantment to Sunny. To go into
her own room in the dark, brush her hand
along the wall, touch an ivory button, and see
the room spring into light charmed her beyond
words. So, too, the black buttons that, pressed,
caused bells to ring in the lower part of the
house. But the speaking tube amazed and at
first almost terrified her. Jerry sprang the
works on her first. While in her room, a sudden
screech coming from the wall, she looked
panically about her, and then started back as
a voice issued forth from that tube, hailing
her by name. Spirits! Here in this so solid
and material America! It was only after
Jerry, getting no response to his calls of
&quot;Sunny! Hi! Sunny! Come on down!
Come on down! Sunny! I want you!&quot; ran
up the stairs, knocked at her door and stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
laughing at her in the doorway, that the
colour came back to her cheeks. He was so
delighted with the experiments, that he led
her to the telephone and initiated her into that
mystery. To watch Sunny's face, as with
parted lips, and eyes darkened by excitement,
she listened to the voice of Jinx, Monty or
Bobs, and then suddenly broke loose and chattered
sweet things back, was in the opinion of
Jerry worth the price of a dozen telephones.
However, he cut short her interviews with the
delighted fellows at the other end, as he did not
wish to have them impose on her good nature
and take up too much of the girl's time.</p>

<p class="indent">The victrola and the player-piano worked
day and night in Sunny's behalf, and it was not
long before she could trill back some of the
songs. Upon one occasion they pulled up the
rugs, and Sunny had her first lesson in dancing.
Jerry told her she took to dancing &quot;like
a duck does to water.&quot; He honestly believed
he was doing a benevolent and worthy act in
surrounding the young girl with his arms and
moving across the floor with her to the music
of the victrola. He would not for worlds have
admitted to himself that as his arms encircled
Sunny, Jerry felt just about as near to heaven
as he ever hoped to get, though premonitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
that all was not normal with him came hazily to
his mind as he dimly realised that that tingling
sensation that contact with Sunny created was
symptomatic of the chaos within. However,
dancing with Sunny, once she had acquired the
step, which she, a professional dancer in Japan,
sensed immediately, was sheer joy, and all
would have been well, had not his friends
arrived just when they were not wanted, and,
of course, Sunny, the little fool, had instantly
wanted to try her new accomplishment upon
her admiring and too willing friends. The
consequence was Jerry's evening was completely
spoiled, and what he meant just as an
innocent diversion was turned into a &quot;riotous
occasion&quot; by a &quot;bunch of roughnecks,&quot; who
took advantage of a little innocent girl's eagerness
to learn to dance, and handled her &quot;a
damn sight too familiarly&quot; to suit the paternal&mdash;he
considered it paternal&mdash;taste of Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry, as Sunny passed in the arms of the
light-footed Jinx, whose dancing was really
an accomplishment, registered several vows.
One was he proposed to give Sunny herself
a good calling down. The other he purposed
curtailing some of the visits of the gang, and
putting a stop once and for all to the flow of
gifts that were in his opinion rotten taste on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
part of Jinx, a joke coming from Monty,
plainly suffering a bad case of puppy love, and
as for Bobs, no one knew better than Jerry
did that he could ill afford to enter into a
flower competition with Jinx. That Rolls
Royce, when not bearing the enchanted Sunny
through the parks and even on little expeditions
into the byways and highways of the
Great White Road, which runs through Westchester
county, was parked not before Jinx's
club, or the garage, but, with amazing impudence
before the door of that duplex studio.
Jerry intended to have a heart-to-heart talk
with old Jinx on that score.</p>

<p class="indent">Even at home, Sunny had wrought havoc.
Before she had been three days upon the place,
Hatton, the stony faced and spare of tongue,
had confided to her the whole history of his
life, and explained how his missus had driven
him to drink.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's 'ard on a man, miss. 'E tries to do 'is
best in life, but it's 'ard, miss, when there's a
woman 'as believes the worst, and brings out
the worst in a man, miss, and man is only
yuman, only yuman, miss, and all yuman beings
'as their failings, as no doubt you know,
miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny did know. She told Hatton that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
was full of failings. She didn't think him a
bad man at all because once in a long time he
drank a little bit. Lots of men did that.
There was the Count of Matsuyama. He had
made many gifts to the Shiba temple, but he
loved sake very much, and often in the tea-gardens
the girls were kept up very late,
because the Count of Matsuyama never returned
home till he had drunk all the sake on
the place, and that took many hours.</p>

<p class="indent">Gratuitously, and filled with a sudden noble
purpose, Hatton gave Sunny his solemn
promise never again to touch the inebriating
cup. She clapped her hands with delight at
this, and cried.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! How you are nicer man now. Mebbe
you wife she come bag agin unto you. How
thad will be happy for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, miss,&quot; sadly and hastily Hatton
rejoined, &quot;you see, miss, there was another
woman in the case also, what the French call,
miss: Shershy la Fam. I'm sorry, miss, but
I'm only yuman, beggin' your pardon, miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny had assumed many of the duties that
were previously Hatton's. The kitchenette
was her especial delight. Here swathed in a
long pongee smock, her sleeves rolled up,
Sunny concocted some of those delectable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
dishes which her friends named variously:
Sunny Syndicate Cocktail; Puree al la
Sunny; Potatoes au Sunny; Sweet pickles
par la Sunny, and so forth. Her thrift also
cut down Jerry's bills considerably, and he
was really so proud of her abilities in this line
that he gave a special dinner to which he generously
invited all three of their mutual
friends, and announced at the table that the
meal was entirely concocted by Sunny at a
price inconceivably low.</p>

<p class="indent">The pice de resistance of this especial feast
was a potato dish. Served in a casserole, it
might at first sight have been taken for a glorified
potatoes au gratin; but, no, when tasted
it revealed its superior qualities. The flushed
and pleased Sunny, sitting at the head of the
table, and dishing out the third or fourth serving
to her admiring friends, was induced to
reveal to her friends of what the dish was composed.
The revelation, it is regrettable to
state, convulsed and disconcerted her friends
so that they ceased to eat the previously much
appreciated dish. Sunny proudly informed
them that her dish was made up mainly of
potato peelings, washed, minced and scrambled
in a mess of odds and ends in the way of
pieces of cheese, mushrooms, meat, and various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
vegetables garnered from plates of a recently
wasteful meal.</p>

<p class="indent">Her explanation caused such a profound silence
for a moment, which was followed by
uneasy and then unrepressed mirth, that she
was disconcerted and distressed. Her friends
consoled her by telling her that it didn't matter
what she made dishes of; everything she
did was exactly right, which made it a bit
harder to explain that the shining pan under
the kitchen sink was the proper receptacle for
all leftovers on the plates. She was reconciled
completely moreover, when Jerry assured her
that the janitor was kicking over the empty
dinner pails that she had been sending down
the dumbwaiter.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IX</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny had certain traits that contributed
largely to what seemed almost an unconscious
conspiracy to rob Jerry Hammond of
his peace of mind. There was a resemblance
in her nature to a kitten.</p>

<p class="indent">To maintain a proper decorum in his relations
with his guest, Jerry was wont, when
alone, to form the firm resolution to hold her
at arm's length. This was far from being an
easy matter. It was impossible for him to be
in the room with Sunny and not sooner or
later find her in touch with him. She had a
habit of putting her hand into his. She slipped
under his most rigid guard, and acquired a
bad trick of pressing close to his side, and
putting her arm through his. This was all
very well when they took their long walks
through the park or up and down Riverside
Drive. She could not see the reason why if
she could walk arm in arm with Jerry when
they climbed on the top of one of the busses
that rolled up the wonderful drive she should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
not continue linked with her friend. In fact,
Sunny found it far more attractive and comfortable
to drive arm in arm with Jerry than
walk thus with him. For, when walking, she
loved to rove off from the paths, to make
acquaintance with the squirrels and the
friendly dogs.</p>

<p class="indent">Her near proximity, however, had its most
dangerous effect in the charmed evenings
these two spent together, too often, however,
marred by the persistent calls of their mutual
friends. At these times, Sunny had an uncanny
trick of coming up at the back of Jerry,
when that unconscious young man by the fireplace
was off in a day dream (in which, by the
way, in a vague way, herself was always a
part), and resting her cheek upon the brown
comfortable head, there to stay till her warm
presence startled him into wakefulness, and
he would explode one of his usual expressions
of these days:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't do that, I say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep your hands off me, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't come so close.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep off&mdash;keep off, I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For heaven's sake, Sunny, will nothing
teach you civilised ways?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span></p>

<p class="indent">At these times Sunny always retired very
meekly to a distant part of the room, where
she would remain very still and crushed looking,
and, shortly, Jerry, overcome with compunction,
would coax her to a nearer proximity
mentally and physically.</p>

<p class="indent">Another disturbing trick which Jerry never
had had the heart to ban was that of kneeling
directly in front of him, her two hands upon
his own knees. From this vantage point, with
her friendly expressive and so lovely face
raised to his, she would navely pour out to
him her innocent confidences. After all, he
savagely argued within himself, what harm in
the world was there in a little girl kneeling by
your side, and even laying her head, if it came
down to that, at times upon a fellow's knee?
It took a rotten mind to discover anything
wrong with that, in the opinion of Jerry Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">However, there is a limit to all things, and
that limit was reached on a certain evening in
early spring, a dangerous season, as we all
know. &quot;If you give some people an inch
they'll take a mile,&quot; Jerry at that time angrily
muttered, the humour of the situation not at
all appealing to him.</p>

<p class="indent">He was going over a publication on Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Architecture, Catalonian work of the 14th
and 15th centuries. Sunny was enjoying herself
very innocently at the piano player, and
Jerry should, as he afterwards admitted to
himself, have &quot;left well enough alone.&quot; However
it be, nothing would do but he must summon
Sunny to his side to share the pleasure
of looking at these splendid examples of the
magnificent work of the great Spanish architect
Fabre.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Sunny possessed, to an uncanny degree,
that gift of understanding which is
extremely rare with her sex. She possessed
it, in fact, to such a fine degree, that nearly
everyone who met her found himself pouring
out the history of his life into her sympathetic
and understanding little ear. There was
something about her way of looking at one, a
sort of hanging absorbedly upon one's narrative
of their history, that assured the narrator
that he not only had the understanding but the
sympathy of his pretty listener.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry, therefore, summoned her from her
diversions at the piano-player, which she hastened
to leave, though the record was her favourite,
&quot;Gluhwormchen.&quot; Her murmuring
exclamations above his shoulder revealed her
instant enthusiasm and appreciation of just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
those details that Jerry knew would escape the
less artistic eye of an ordinary person. She
held pages open, to prolong the pleasure of
looking at certain window traceries; she picked
out easily the Geometrical Gothic type, and
wanted Jerry's full explanation as to its difference
to those of another period. Her little
pink forefinger ever found points of interest
in the sketches which made him chuckle with
delight and pride. The value of Sunny's criticism
and opinion, moreover, was enhanced by
the fact that she conveyed to the young man
her conviction, that while of course these were
incredibly marvellous examples of the skill of
ancient Spanish architects, they were not a
patch on the work which J. Addison Hammond
was going to do in the not far distant
future. Though he protested against this with
proper modesty, he was nevertheless beguiled
and bewitched by the shining dream she called
up. He had failed to note that she was
perched on the arm of his chair, and that her
head rested perilously near to his own. Possibly
he would never have discovered this at
all had not an accident occurred that sent
Hatton, busy on some task or other about the
studio, scurrying in undignified flight from the
room, with his stony face covered with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
hands. From the kitchen regions thereafter
came the sound of suppressed clucks, which by
this time could have been recognised as Hatton's
laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">What happened was this: At a moment
when a turned leaf revealed a sketch of ravishing
splendour, Sunny's breathless admiration,
and Jerry's own motion of appreciation (one
fist clapped into the palm of the other hand),
caused Sunny to slip from the arm of the chair
onto Jerry's knee.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry arose. To do him justice, he arose
instantly, depositing both book and Sunny
upon the floor. He then proceeded to read her
such a savage lecture upon her pagan ways,
that the evident effect was so instantly apparent
on her, that he stopped midway, glared,
stared at the crushed little figure, so tenderly
closing the upset book, and then turned on
his heel and made an ignominious and undignified
exit from the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the use? What's the use?&quot; demanded
Jerry of the unresponsive walls.
&quot;Hang it all, this sort of thing has got to stop.
What in Sam Hill is keeping that blamed
Proff?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He always liked to imagine at these times
that his faith was pinned upon the early coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
of Professor Barrowes, when he was
assured the hectic state of affairs in his studio
would be clarified and Sunny disposed of once
and forever. Sunny, however, had been nearly
a month now in his studio, and in spite of a
hundred telegrams to Professor Barrowes,
demanding to know the exact time of his
arrival, threatening moreover to hold back
that $2,000 required to bring the dashed Dinornis
from Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, to
New York City, U. S. A., he got no satisfactory
response from his old-time teacher. That
monomaniac merely replied with letter-long
telegrams&mdash;very expensive coming from the
extreme northwestern part of Canada to New
York City, giving more detailed information
about the above mentioned Dinornis, or
Dynosaurus, or whatever he called it, and explaining
why more and more funds were
required. It seems the Professor was tangled
up in quite a serious dispute with the Canadian
authorities. Some indignant English
residents of Canada had aroused the alarm of
Canadians, by pointing out that Dynosaureses
were worth as much as radium, and that a
mere Yankee should not be permitted to carry
off those fossilized bones of the original inhabitants
of Canada, which ought, instead, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
donated to the noble English nation across the
sea.</p>

<p class="indent">As Jerry paced his floor he paused to reread
the words of the motto recently pinned
upon his wall, and, of course, it was as follows:
&quot;Honi soit qui mal y pense.&quot; That was enough
for Jerry. There was no question of the fact
that he had been &quot;a pig and a brute,&quot; terms
often in these days applied by himself to himself.
Sunny was certainly not to be blamed for
the accident of slipping from the arm of his
chair. True, he had already told her that she
was not to sit on that arm, but that was a minor
matter, and there was no occasion for his making
a &quot;mountain out of a molehill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having arrived at the conclusion that, as
usual, he, not Sunny, was the one to blame, it
was in the nature of Jerry that he should hurriedly
descend to admit his fault. Downstairs,
therefore again, and into the now empty
studio. Sounds came from the direction of
the kitchen that were entirely too sweet to
belong to the &quot;pie-faced&quot; Hatton, whose disgusting
recent mirth might mean the loss of
his job, ominously thought Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">In the kitchen Sunny was discovered on her
knees with her lips close to a small hole in the
floor in the corner of the room. She was half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
whistling, half whispering, and she was scattering
something into and about that hole,
which had been apparently cut out with a
vegetable knife, that looked very much like
cheese and breadcrumbs. Presently the
amazed Jerry saw first one and then another
tiny face appear at that hole, and there then
issued forth a full-fledged family of the
mouse species, young and old, large and
small, male and female. The explanation of
the previously inexplicable appearance in the
studio of countless mice was now perfectly
clear, and the guiltlessness of that accused
janitor made visible. Jerry's ward had been
feeding and cultivating mice! At his exclamation,
she arose reproachfully, the mice scampering
back into their hole.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; said Sunny, regret, not guilt, visible
on her face, &quot;you are fright away my honourable
mice, and thas hees time eat on hees
dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put the rest of her crumbs into the
hole, and called down coaxingly to her pets
that breakfast would be ready next day.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mustn't feed mice, you little fool!&quot;
burst from Jerry. &quot;They'll be all over the
house. They are now. Everybody in the
building's kicking about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honourable mice very good animals,&quot; said
Sunny with conviction. &quot;Mebbe some you and
my ancestor are mice now. You kinnod tell
'bout those. Mice got very honourable history
ad Japan. I am lig' them very much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That'll do. Don't say another word. I'll
fix 'em. Hi! you, Hatton! Doggone you,
you must have known about this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very sorry, sir, but orders from you, sir,
was to allow Miss Sunny to have her way in
the kitchen, sir. 'Hi tries to obey you, sir,
and 'hi 'adn't the 'eart to deprive Miss Sunny
of her honly pets, sir. She's honly yuman, sir,
and being alone 'hall day, so young, sir, 'as
'ankerings for hinnocent things to play with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That'll do, Hatton. Nail up that hole.
Get busy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, Hatton's words sunk into the
soul of Jerry. To think that even the poor
working man was kinder to little Sunny than
was he! He ignored the fact that as Hatton
nailed tin over the guilty hole his shoulders
were observed to be shaking, and those spasmodic
clucks emanated at intervals also from
him. In fact, Hatton, in these days, had lost
all his previously polished composure. That
is to say, at inconvenient moments, he would
burst into this uncontrollable clucking, as for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
instance, when waiting on table, observing a
guest devouring some special edible concocted
by Sunny, he retired precipitately from service
at the table to the kitchen, to be discovered
there by the irate Jerry, who had followed him,
sitting on a chair with tears running down his
cheeks. To the threatened kicking if he didn't
get up and behave himself, Hatton returned:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, sir, hi ham honly yuman, and the
gentleman was ravim' so about them 'spinnuges,'
sir, has 'ees hafter calling them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, what are they then?&quot; demanded
Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Them's weeds, sir,&quot; whispered Hatton wiping
his eyes. &quot;Miss Sunny, I seen her diggin'
them up in the lot across the way, and she
come up the fire escape with them in 'er petticoat,
sir, and she 'ad four cats in the petticoat
also, sir. She's feedin' arf the population of
cats in this neighbourhood, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry had been only irritated at that time.
He knew that Sunny's &quot;weeds&quot; were perfectly
edible and far more toothsome in fact than
mere spinach. Trust her Japanese knowledge
to know what was what in the vegetable kingdom.
However, mice were a more serious matter.
There was an iron clad rule in the building
that no live stock of any kind, neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
dogs, cats, parrots, or birds or reptiles of any
description, (babies included in the ban) were
to be lodged on these de luxe premises. Still,
as Jerry watched Sunny's brimming eyes, the
eyes of one who sees her dear friends imprisoned
and doomed to execution, while Hatton
nailed the tin over the holes, he felt extremely
mean and cruel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm awfully sorry, Sunny, old scout,&quot; he
said, &quot;but you know we can't possibly have
<i>mice</i> on the place. Now if it were something
like&mdash;like, well a dog, for instance&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>are</i> got a nize dog,&quot; said Sunny, beginning
to smile through her tears.</p>

<p class="indent">Apprehension instantly replaced the compunction
on Jerry's face&mdash;apprehension that
turned to genuine horror, however, when
Sunny opened the window onto the fire escape,
and showed him a large grocer's box, upholstered
and padded with a red article that
looked suspiciously like a Japanese petticoat.
Digging under this padded silk, Sunny
brought forth the yellowest, orneriest, scurviest
and meanest-looking specimen of the dog
family that it had ever been Jerry's misfortune
to see. She caught this disreputable object to
her breast, and nestled her darling little chin
against the wriggling head, that persisted in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
ducking up to release a long red tongue that
licked her face with whines of delight and
appreciation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! For the love of Mike! Where in
the name of all the pagan gods and goddesses
of Japan did you get that god-forsaken mutt
from? If you wanted a dog, why in Sam
Hill didn't you tell me, and I'd have gotten
you a regular dog&mdash;if they'd let me in the
house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, he are a regular dog also. I buyed
him from the butcher gentleman, who was
mos' kind, and he charge me no moaney for
those dog, bi-cause he are say he are poor mans,
and those dog came off those street and eat
him up those sausage. So that butcher gentleman
he are sell him to me, and he are my
own dog, and I are love my Itchy mos' bes' of
all dogs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And she hugged her little cur protectingly
to her breast, her bright eyes with the defiant
look of a little mother at bay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Itchy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thad are my dog's name. The butcher
gentleman, he say he are scratch on his itch all
those time, so I are name him Itchy. Also I
are cure on those itch spot, for I are wash him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
every day, and now he are so clean he got
only two flea left on his body.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By what process of mathematics, will you
tell me, did you arrive at the figure of two?&quot;
demanded the stunned young man, thrusting
his two fists deep into his pocket and surveying
Sunny and the aforesaid dog as one might
curious specimens in the Bronx zoo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two? Two flea?&quot; Sunny passed her hand
lovingly and sympathetically over her dog's
yellow body, and replied so simply that even
an extremely dense person would have been
able to answer that arithmetic problem.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He are scratch him in two place only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry threw back his head and burst into
immoderate laughter. He laughed so hard
that he was obliged to sit down on a chair,
while Hatton on the floor sat down solidly
also, and desisted with his hammering. Jerry's
mirth having had full sway, hands in pocket
he surveyed Sunny, as, lovingly, she returned
her protesting cur to its silken retreat.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! Sunny!&quot; said Jerry, shaking his
head. &quot;You'll be the death of me yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny regarded him earnestly at that.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Jerry, do not say those. I are not
want to make you death. Thas very sad&mdash;for
die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are we going to do about it? They'll
never let you keep a dog here. Against the
rules.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, it are no longer 'gainst those rule.
I are speag wiz the janitor gentleman, and
he are say: 'Thas all ride, seein' it's you!'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did, did he? Got around him too, did
you? You'll have the whole place demoralised
if you keep on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are also speag ad those landlord,&quot; confessed
Sunny innocently, &quot;bi-cause he are
swear on those janitor gentleman, account
someone ad these house are spik to him thad
I are got dog. And thad landlord gentleman
he come up here ad these studio, and I show
him those dog, and he say he are nize dog, and
thad those fire escape he is not <i>inside</i>. So I
nod break those rule, and he go downstairs
spik ad those lady mek those complain, and
he say he doan keer if she dam clear out this
house. He doan lig' her which even.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry threw up his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You win, Sunny! Do as you like. Fill
the place full if you want to. There's horses
and cows to be had if they strike your fancy,
and the zoo is full of other kind of live stock.
Take your choice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, indeed, did proceed to take her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
choice. It is true she did not bring horses and
cows and wild animals into Jerry's apartment;
but she passed the word to her doting friends,
and in due time the inmates of that duplex
apartment made quite a considerable family,
with promise of early increase. There was
besides Itchy, Count and Countess Taguchi,
overfed canaries, who taught Sunny a new
kind of whistle; Mr. and Mrs. Satsuma, goldfish
who occupied an ornate glass and silver
dish, fern and rock lined donated by Jinx, and
Miss Spring Morning, a large Persian cat,
whom Sunny named after her old friend of the
teahouse of a Thousand Joys, but whose name
should have been Mr. Spring Morning.</p>

<p class="indent">It was a very happy family indeed, and in
time the master of the house became quite
accustomed to the pets (pests he called them at
first), and had that proud feeling moreover of
the contented man of family. He often fed
the Satsumas and Taguchis himself, and
actually was observed to scratch the head of
Itchy, who in these days penetrated into the
various rooms of the apartment (Sunny having
had especial permission from the janitor
gentleman) so long as his presence was noiseless.
He wore on his scrawny neck a fine
leather and gilt collar that Monty sent all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
way to Philadelphia to get for Sunny, thereby
earning the bitter resentment of his kid
brother, who considered that collar his by
rightful inheritance from Monty's own recent
kid days. Monty's remorse upon &quot;swiping&quot;
said collar was shortlived, however, for
Sunny's smile and excitement and the fun they
had putting it on Itchy more than compensated
for any bitter threats of an unreasonable kid
brother. Besides Monty brought peace in
that disturbed direction by sending the
younger Potter a brand new collar, not, it
is true, of the history of the one taken, but
much more shiny and semi-adjustable.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER X</p>

<p class="indent">On the 20th of April, Sunny's friend,
&quot;Mr. dear Monty&quot; as she called him
(J. Lamont Potter, Jr., was his real name),
obtained an indefinite leave of absence from
the hospital, and called upon Sunny in the
absence of Jerry Hammond. He came directly
to the object of his call almost as soon
as Sunny admitted him. While indeed she
was assisting him to remove that nice, loosely
hanging taupe coloured spring coat, that
looked so well on Monty, he swung around, as
his arms came out of his coat sleeves, and made
Sunny an offer of his heart and soul. These
the girl very regretfully refused. Follows the
gist of Sunny's remarks in rejection of the
offer:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty, I do not wan' gettin' marry wiz
you jos yet, bi-cause you are got two more
year to worg on those hospital; then you are
got go unto those John Hoppakins for post&mdash;something
kind worg also. Then you are go
ad those college and hospital in Hy&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
tried to say Heidelberg, but the word was too
much for her, and he broke in impetuously:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Listen, Sunny, those <i>were</i> my plans, but
everything's changed now, since I met you.
I've decided to cut it all out and settle down
and marry. I've got my degree, and can hang
out my shingle. We'll have to economize a
bit at first, because the governor, no doubt, will
cut me out for doing this; but I'm not in swaddling
clothes, and I'll do as I like. So what
do you say, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, thas nod ride do those. Your honourable
father, he are spend plenty moany for
you, and thas unfilial do lig' thad. I thang
you, Monty, but I are sawry I kinnod do lig'
you ask.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But look here, Sunny, there are whole
heaps of fellows&mdash;dubs who never go beyond
taking their degree, who go to practising right
away, and I can do as they do, as far as that
goes, and with you I should worry whether I
go up in medicine or not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Monty, I <i>wan</i> see you go up&mdash;Ho!
up, way high to those top. Thas mos' bes'
thing do for gentleman. I do nod lig' man
who stay down low on ground. Thas nod nize.
I do nod wan' make marry wiz gentleman lig'
those.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We-el, I suppose I could go on with the
work and study. If I did, would you wait for
me? Would you, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do not know, Monty. How I kin see all
those year come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, but you can promise me, can't
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Monty, bi-cause mebbe I goin' die, and
then thas break promise. Thas not perlite do
lig' those.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pshaw! There's no likelihood at all of
your dying. You're awfully healthy. Anyone
can see it by your colouring. By jove, Sunny,
you have the prettiest complexion of any girl
I've ever seen. Your cheeks are just like
flowers. Die! You're bugs to think of it even.
So you are perfectly safe in promising.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We-el, then I promise that mebbe after
those five, six year when you are all troo, <i>if</i>
I are not marry wiz someone else, then I go
<i>consider</i> marry wiz you, Monty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This gracious speech was sweetened by an
engaging smile, and Monty, believing that
&quot;half a loaf is better than no loaf&quot; showed his
pleasure, though his curiosity prompted him
to make anxious inquiry as to possible rivals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobs asked you yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;not yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wouldn't take him if he did, would you,
Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Not yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or any time. Say that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any time, Monty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And Jinx? What about Jinx?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He are always my good friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wouldn't marry him, would you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. I are lig' him as frien'.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Monty pursued no further. He knew of the
existence of Jerry's Miss Falconer. Dashed,
but not hopeless Monty withdrew.</p>

<p class="indent">That was on the 20th of April. Bob's proposal
followed on the 22nd. He inveigled
Sunny into accompanying him to his polished
and glorified flat, which was presided over by
an ample bosomed and smiling &quot;mammy&quot;
whom Bobs had especially imported from the
sunny South.</p>

<p class="indent">His guest, having exclaimed and enthused
over the really cosy and bright little flat, Bobs,
with his fine, clever face aglow, asked her to
share it with him. The request frightened
Sunny. She had exhausted considerable of her
stock of excuses against matrimony to Monty,
and she did not want to see that look of hope
fade from Mr. dear Bobs' face.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Bobs, I are <i>thad</i> sorry, but me? I do
not wan make marry jos yet. Please you waid
for some udder day when mebbe perhaps I go
change those mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all right, Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs took his medicine like a man, his clean
cut face slightly paling, as he followed with a
question the lightness of which did not deceive
the distressed Sunny:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're not engaged to anyone else, are
you, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Emgaged? What are those, Bobs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You haven't promised any other lucky dog
that you'll marry him, have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o.&quot; Sunny shook her bright head.
&quot;No one are ask me yet, 'cept Monty, and I
are say same ting to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; Bobs beamed through his disappointment
on her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;While there's life there's hope, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He felt that Jinx's chances were slim, and
he, too, knew of Miss Falconer and Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, by no means elated by her two proposals,
confided in Hatton, and received sage
advice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Sunny, Hi'm not hin a position exactly
to advise you, and hits 'ardly my place,
miss, but so long as you hasks my hadvice, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
gives it you grattus. Now Mr. Potter, 'ees
a trifle young for matrimunny, miss&mdash;a
trifle young, and Mr. Mapson, I 'ear that 'ees
not got hany too much money, and hits a beggarly
profession 'ees followin', miss. I 'ave
'eard this from Mr. Jerry's hown folks, 'oo
more than once 'as cast haspirations against
Mr. Jerry's friends, but hi takes it that wot
they're sayin' comes near to the truth habout
the newspaper as a perfession, miss. Now
there's Mr. Crawford, Miss&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hatton's voice took on both a respectful and
a confidential tone as he came to Jinx.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Hi flatters myself that Hi'm some
judge of yuman nature, miss, and I make bold
to say, hif I may, miss, that Mr. Crawford his
about halso to pop the 'appy question to you,
miss. Now, hif hi was hin your place, miss,
'ees the gentleman hi'd be after 'ooking. His
people hare of the harristocrissy of Hamerica&mdash;so
far, miss, as Hamerica can 'ave harristocrissy&mdash;and
Mr. Crawford his the hair to a
varst fortune, miss. There's no telling to wot
'eights you might climb if you buckles up with
Mr. Crawford, Miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! Hatton, I lig' all those my frien' jos
same. Me? I would lig' marry all those, but
I kinnod do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Ardly, miss, 'ardly. Hamerica is 'ardly a
pollagamous country, though 'hit his the 'ome
of the Mormon people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mormon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A church, miss; a sex of people wots given
to pollagummy, which is, I takes it, too 'ard
and big a word for you, miss, bein' a forriner,
to hunderstand, so hi'll explain a bit clearer,
miss. The Mormon people hacquire several
wives, some helders 'avin' the reputation of
bein' in the class with hour hown King 'Enry
the Heighth, and worse, miss,&mdash;with Solomon
'imself, I 'ave 'eard it said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho-h-a-!&quot; said Sunny thoughtfully.
&quot;Thad is very nize&mdash;those Mormon. Thas
lig' Japanese emperor. Some time he got lots
wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hatton wiped the sweat from his brow. He
had gotten upon a subject somewhat beyond
his depths, and the young person before him
rather scandalised his ideas of what a young
lady's views on such matters should be. He
had hoped to shock Sunny somewhat. Instead
she sighed with an undeniably envious accent
as he told her of the reprehensible Mormons.
After a moment she asked very softly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatton, mebbe Jerry ask me those same
question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Hatton turned his back, and fussed with the
dishes in the sink. He too knew about Miss
Falconer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Ardly, miss, 'ardly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not, Hatton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you'll pardon me, I 'ave a great deal of
work before me. Hi'm in a 'urry. 'Ave you
fed the Count and Countess Taguchi, may I
ask, miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatton, <i>if</i> a man <i>not</i> ask girl to make
marry wiz him, what she can do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well now, miss, you got me there. Has
far as Hi'm hable to see personally, miss, there
haren't nothing left for 'er to do except wait
for the leap year.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Leap year? What are those, Hatton?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A hodd year, miss&mdash;comes just in so often,
miss, due to come next year, halso. When the
leap year comes, miss, then the ladies do the
popping&mdash;they harsks the 'appy question,
miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;O-h-h-! Thas very nize. I wish it are
leap year now,&quot; said Sunny wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hit'll come, miss. Hit's on hit's way. A
few months and then the ladies' day will
dawn,&quot; and Hatton, moving about with cheer,
clucked at the thought.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XI</p>

<p class="indent">A week after Bobs proposed to Sunny,
Jinx, shining like the rising sun by an
especially careful grooming administered by
his valet, a flower adorning his lapel, and a
silk hat topping his head, with a box of chocolates
large enough to hold an Easter bonnet
in his hand, and a smaller box of another kind
in his vest pocket, presented himself at Jerry
Hammond's studio. Flowers preceded and
followed this last of Sunny's ardent suitors.</p>

<p class="indent">He was received by a young person arrayed
in a pink pongee smock, sleeves rolled up,
revealing a pair of dimpled arms, hair in distracting
disorder, and a little nose on which
seductively perched a blotch of flour, which the
infatuated Jinx was requested to waft away
with his silken handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny's cheeks were flushed from close
proximity to that gas stove, and her eyes were
bright with the warfare which she waged incessantly
upon the aforesaid honourable stove.
In the early days of her appearance at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
studio&mdash;by the way, she had been domiciled
there a whole month&mdash;Sunny's operations at
the gas stove had had disastrous results. Her
attempt to boil water by the simple device of
turning on the gas, as she did the electric
light was alarming in its odorous effects, but
her efforts to blow out the oven was almost
calamitous, and caused no end of excitement,
for it singed her hair and eyebrows and
scorched an arm that required the persistent
and solicitous attention of her four friends, a
doctor and the thoroughly agitated Hatton, on
whose head poured the full vials of Jerry's
wrath and blame. In fact, this accident almost
drove Hatton to desert what he explained to
Sunny was the &quot;water wagon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After that Sunny was strictly ordered by
Jerry to keep out of the kitchen. Realising,
however, that she could not be trusted on that
score, he took half a day off from the office, and
gave her a full course of instruction in the
mysteries and works of said gas stove. It
should be assumed therefore that by this time
Sunny should have acquired at least a primary
knowledge of the stove. Not so, however.
She never lit the oven but she threw salt about
to propitiate the oni (goblin) which she was
sure had its home somewhere in that strange
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
fire, and she hesitated to touch any of the
levers once the fire was lit.</p>

<p class="indent">Most of the dishes created by Sunny were
more or less under the eye of Hatton, but on
this day Hatton had stepped out to the
butcher's. Therefore Jinx's arrival was hailed
by Sunny with appreciation and relief, and
she promptly lead the happy fellow to the
kitchen and solicited his advice. Now Jinx,
the son of the plutocratic rich, had never been
inside a kitchen since his small boyhood, and
then his recollection of said portion of the
house was of a vast white place, where tiles
and marble and white capped cooks prevailed,
and small boys were chuckled over or stared
at and whispered about.</p>

<p class="indent">The dimensions of Sunny's kitchen were
about seven by nine feet, and it is well to mention
at this moment that the room registered
95 degrees Fahrenheit. Jinx weighed two
hundred and forty-five pounds, stripped. His
emotions, his preparations, his hurry to enter
the presence of his charmer, to say nothing of
a volcanic heart, all contributed to add to the
heat and discomfort of the fat young man
down whose ruddy cheeks the perspiration
rolled. Jinx had come upon a mission that in
all times in the history of the world, subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
to cave days, has called for coolness, tact, and
as attractive a physical seeming as it is possible
to attain.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny drew her friend along to that gas
stove, kneeled on the floor, making room for
him to kneel beside her&mdash;no easy &quot;stunt&quot; for
a fat man&mdash;opened the lower door and revealed
to him the jets on full blaze. Jinx
shook his head. The problem was beyond him,
but even as his head shook he sniffed a certain
fragrant odour that stole directly to a
certain point in Jinx's anatomy that Sunny
would quaintly have designated as his &quot;honourable
insides.&quot; The little kitchen, despite its
heat, contained in that oven, Jinx knew, that
which was more attractive than anything the
cool studio could offer. Seating himself
heavily on a frail kitchen chair, which creaked
ominously under his weight, Jinx awaited
hopefully what he felt sure was soon to
follow.</p>

<p class="indent">In due time Sunny opened the upper door
of the oven, withdrew two luscious looking
pans of the crispest brown rice cakes, plentifully
besprinkled with dates and nuts and
over which she dusted powdered sugar, and
passing by the really suffering Jinx she transferred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
the pans to the window ledge, saying
with a smile:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When he are cool, I giving you one,
Jinx.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wiping her hands on the roller towel, she
had Jinx pull the smock over her head, and
revealed her small person in blue taffeta
frock, which Jinx himself had had the honour
of choosing for her. Unwillingly, and
with one longing backward look at those
cakes, Jinx followed Sunny into the studio.
Here, removed from the intoxicating effects of
that kitchen, Sunny having his full attention
again, he came to the object of his call. Jinx
sat forward on the edge of his chair, and his
round, fat face looked so comically like the
man in the moon's that Sunny could not forbear
smiling at him affectionately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! Jinx, how you are going to lig' those
cake when he is getting cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx liked them hot just as well. However,
he was not such a gourmand that mere rice
and date cakes could divert him from the purpose
of his call. He sighed so deeply and his
expression revealed such a condition of melancholy
appeal that Sunny, alarmed, moved over
and took his face up in her hand, examining it
like a little doctor, head cocked on one side.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx, you are sick? What you are eat?
Show me those tongue!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aw, it's nothing, Sunny&mdash;nothing to do
with my tongue. It's&mdash;it's&mdash;just a little heart
trouble, Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Heart! That are bad place be sick! You
are ache on him, Mr. dear Jinx?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ye-eh&mdash;some.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sawry! How I are sawry! You have
see doctor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're the only doctor I need.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Which was true enough. It was surprising
the healing effects upon Jinx's aching heart
of the solicitous and sympathetic hovering
about him of Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jinx, I go at those telephone ride
away, get him Mr. Doctor here come. I 'fraid
mebbe you more sick than mebbe you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no&mdash;never mind a doctor.&quot; Jinx held
her back by force. &quot;Look-a-here, Sunny, I'll
tell you just what's the matter with my heart.
I'm&mdash;I'm&mdash;in love!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh&mdash;love. I have hear those word bi-fore,
but I have never feel him,&quot; said Sunny wistfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll feel it some day all right,&quot; groaned
Jinx. &quot;And you'll know it too when you've
got it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ad Japan nobody&mdash;love. Thas not nize
word speag ad Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gosh! it's the nicest word in the language
in America. You can't help speaking it. You
can't help feeling it. When you're in love,
Sunny, you think day and night and every
hour and minute and second of the day of the
same person. That's love, Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; whispered Sunny, her eyes very
bright and dewey, &quot;I are <i>know</i> him then!&quot;
And she stood with that rapt look, scarcely
hearing Jinx, and brought back to earth only
when he took her hand, and clung to it with
both his own somewhat flabby ones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, I'm head over heels in love with
you. Put me out of my misery. Say you'll
be Mrs. Crawford, and you'll see how quickly
this old bunged up heart of mine will heal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jinx, you are ask <i>me</i> to make marry
wiz you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bet your life I am. Gosh! I've got
an awful case on you, Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I sawry I kinnod do thad to-day. I
am not good ad my healt'. Axscuse me.
Mebbe some odder day I do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any day will do. Any day that suits you,
if you'll just give me your promise&mdash;if you'll
just be engaged to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Engaged?&quot; Bobs had already explained
to her what that meant, but she repeated it
to gain time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes&mdash;don't they have engagements
in Japan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Marriage broker go ad girl's father
and boy's father and make those marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, this is a civilised land. We do
things right here. You're a lucky girl to have
escaped from Japan. Here, in this land, we
first get engaged, say for a week or month or
even a year&mdash;only a short time will do for you
and me, Sunny&mdash;and then, well, we marry.
How about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny considered the question from several
serious angles, very thoughtful, very much
impressed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx, I do nod like to make marriage, bi-cause
thas tie me up wiz jos one frien' for
hosban'.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you don't want more than one husband?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx remembered hearing somewhere that
the Japanese were a polygamous nation, but
he thought that only applied to the favoured
males of the race.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&mdash;O thas very nize for Mormon man I
am hear of, bud&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not fit for a woman,&quot; warmly declared
Jinx. &quot;All I ask of you, Sunny, is that you'll
promise to marry me. If you'll do that, you'll
make me the happiest bug in these United
States. I'll be all but looney, and that's a
fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sawry, Jinx, but me? I kinnod do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx relapsed into a state of the darkest
gloom. Looking out from the depths of the
big, soft overstuffed chair, he could see not a
gleam of light, and presently groaned:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose if I weren't such a mass of
flesh and fat, I might stand a show with you.
It's hell to be fat, I'll tell the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx, I lig' those fat. It grow nize on
you. And <i>pleass</i> do not loog so sad on you
face. Wait, I go get you something thas
goin' make you look smile again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She disappeared into the kitchen, returning
with the whole platter of cookies, still quite
warm, and irresistibly odorous and toothsome
looking. Jinx, endeavouring to refuse, had
to close his eyes to steady him in his resolve,
but he could not close his nose, nor his mouth
either, when Sunny thrust one of the delicious
pieces into his mouth. She wooed him back
to a semi-normal condition by feeding him
crisp morsels of his favourite confection, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
was it possible to resist something that pushed
against one's mouth, and once having entered
that orifice revealed qualities that appealed
to the very best in one's nature.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx was not made of the Spartan stuff of
heroes, and who shall blame him if nature
chose to endow him with a form of rich proportions
that included &quot;honourable insides&quot;
whose capacity was unlimited. So, till the
very last cooky, and a sense of well being and
fulness, the sad side of life pushed aside _pro
tem_, Jinx was actually able to smile indulgently
at the solicitous Sunny. She clapped
her hands delightedly over her success. Jinx's
fingers found their way to his vest pocket.
He withdrew a small velvet box, and snapped
back the lid. Silently he held it toward Sunny.
Her eyes wide, she stared at it with excited
rapture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh-h! Thas mos' beautifullest thing I
are ever see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Never, in fact, had her eyes beheld anything
half so lovely as that shining platinum work
of art with its immense diamond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just think,&quot; said Jinx huskily, &quot;if you say
the word, you can have stones like that covering
you all over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All over!&quot; She made an expressive motion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
of her hands which took in all of her small
person.</p>

<p class="indent">Melancholy again clouded Jinx's face.
After all, he did not want Sunny to marry
him for jewelry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you what you do, Sunny. Wear this
for me, will you? Wear it for a while, anyway,
and then when you decide finally whether
you'll have me or not, keep it or send it back,
as you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had slipped the ring onto the third
finger of Sunny's left hand, and holding that
had made him a bit bolder. Sunny, unsuspecting
and sympathetic, let her hand rest in
his, the ring up, where she could admire it
to her heart's content.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look a here, Sunny, will you give me a
kiss, then&mdash;just one. The ring's worth that,
isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny retreated hurriedly, almost panically?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jinx, please you excuse me to-day, bi-cause
I <i>lig'</i> do so, but Mr. Hatton he are
stand ad those door and loog on you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damn Hatty!&quot; groaned Jinx bitterly, and
with a sigh that heaved his big breast aloft,
he picked up his hat and cane, and ponderously
moved toward the door.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span></p>

<p class="indent">In the lower hall of the studio apartment,
who should the crestfallen Jinx encounter but
his old-time friend, Jerry Hammond, returning
from his eight hours' work at the office.
His friend's greeting was both curt and cold,
and there was no mistaking that look of dislike
and disapproval that the frowning face
made no effort to disguise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here again, Jinx. Better move in,&quot; was
Jerry's greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">Jinx muttered something inarticulate and
furious, and for a fat man he made quick
time across the hall and out into the street,
where he climbed with a heavy heart into the
great roadster, which he had fondly hoped
might also carry Sunny with him upon a prolonged
honeymoon.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XII</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny poured Jerry's tea with a hand
turned ostentatiously in a direction that
revealed to his amazed and indignant eye that
enormous stone of fire that blazed on the finger
of Sunny's left hand. His appetite, always
excellent, failed him entirely, and after conquering
the first surge of impulses that were
almost murderous, he lapsed into an ominous
silence, which no guile nor question from the
girl at the head of his table could break. A
steady, a cold, a biting glare, a murmured
monosyllabic reply was all the response she
received to her amiable overtures. His ill
temper, moreover, reached out to the inoffensive
Hatton, whom he ordered to clear out,
and stay out, and if it came down to that get
out altogether, rather than hang around snickering
in that way. Thus Jerry revealed a side
to his character hitherto unsuspected by
Sunny, though several rumblings and barks
from the &quot;dog in the manger&quot; would have
apprized one less innocent than she.</p>

<p class="indent">They finished that meal&mdash;or rather Sunny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
did&mdash;in silence electric with coming strife.
Then Jerry suddenly left the table, strode into
the little hall, took down his hat and coat, and
was about to go, heaven knows where, when
Sunny, at his elbow, sought to restrain him by
force. She took his sleeve and tenaciously
held to it, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, do not go out these night. I are got
some news I lig' tell to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let go my arm. I'm not interested in your
news. I've a date of my own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But Jerry&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I say, let go my arm, will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The last was said in a rising voice, as he
reached the crest of irritation, and jerking his
sleeve so roughly from her clasp, he accomplished
the desired freedom, but the look on
Sunny's face stayed with him all the way down
those apartment stairs&mdash;he ignored the elevator&mdash;and
to the door of the house. There he
stopped short, and without more ado, retraced
his steps, sprang up the stairs in a great hurry,
and jerking open his door again, Jerry returned
to his home. He discovered Sunny
curled on the floor, with her head buried in
the seat of his favourite chair&mdash;the one occupied
that afternoon by the mischief-making
Jinx.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! I'm awfully sorry I was such a
beast. Say, little girl, look here, I'm not myself.
I don't know what I'm doing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny slowly lifted her face, revealing to
the relieved but indignant Jerry a face on
which it is true there were traces of a tear or
two, but which nevertheless smiled at him
quite shamelessly and even triumphantly.
Jerry felt foolish, and he was divided between
a notion to remain at home with the culprit&mdash;she
had done nothing especially wrong, but
he felt that she was to blame for something
or other&mdash;or follow his first intention of going
out for the night&mdash;just where, he didn't know&mdash;but
anywhere would do to escape the
thought that had come to him&mdash;the thought
of Sunny's probable engagement to Jinx.
However, Sunny gave him no time to debate
the matter of his movements for the evening.
She very calmly assisted him to remove his
coat, hung up his hat, and when she had him
comfortably ensconced in his favourite chair,
had herself lit his pipe and handed it to him,
she drew up a stool and sat down in front of
his knees, just as if, in fact, she was entirely
guiltless of an engagement of which Jerry
positively did not intend to approve. Her
audacity, moreover, was such that she did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
hesitate to lay her left hand on Jerry's knee,
where he might get the full benefit of the
radiant light from that ring. He looked at
it, set down his pipe on the stand at his elbow,
and stirred in that restless way which portends
hasty arising, when Sunny:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, Jinx are come to-day to ask me
make marriage with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The big stiff. I pity any girl that has to
go through life with that fathead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I are always lig' thad fat grow on
Jinx. It look very good on him. I are told
him so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matter of taste of course,&quot; snarled Jerry,
fascinated by the twinkling of that ring in
spite of himself, and feeling at that moment
an emotion that was dangerously like hatred
for the girl he had done so much for.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty and Bobs are also ask me marry
wiz them.&quot; Sunny dimpled quite wickedly at
this, but Jerry failed to see any humour in the
matter. He said with assumed loftiness:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, well, proposals raining down on you
in every direction. Your janitor gentleman
and landlord asked you too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o, not yit, but those landlord are say
he lig' take me for ride some nize days on his
car ad those park.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The hell he did!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry sat up with such a savage jerk at this
that he succeeded in upsetting the innocent
hand resting so confidingly upon his knee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who asked him around here anyway?&quot; demanded
Jerry furiously. &quot;Just because he
owns this building doesn't mean he has a right
to impose himself on the tenants, and I'll tell
him so damn quick.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Jerry, <i>I</i> are ask him come up here.
Itchy fall down on those fire escape, and he
are making so much noise on this house when
he cry, that everybody who live on this house
open those windows on court, and I are run
down quick on those fire escape and everybody
also run out see what's all those trouble. Then
I am cry so hard, bi-cause I are afraid Itchy
are hurt himself too bad, bi-cause he also are
cry very loud.&quot; Sunny lifted her nose sky-ward,
illustrating how the dog's cries had
emanated from him. &quot;So then, everybody
<i>very</i> kind at me and Itchy, and the janitor
gentleman carry him bag ad these room, and
the landlord gentleman say thas all ride henceforth
I have thad little dog live wiz me ad these
room also. He say it is very hard for liddle
girl come from country way off be 'lone all
those day, and mebbe some day he take me and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
Itchy for ride ad those park. So I are say,
'Thang you, I will like go vaery much, thang
you.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, make up your mind to it, you're not
going, do you understand? I'll have no landlords
taking you riding in any parks.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having delivered this ultimatum as viciously
as the circumstances called for, Jerry leaned
back in pretended ease and awaited further
revelations from Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;but,&quot; went on Sunny, as if finishing
a sentence, &quot;that landlord gentleman are not
also ask me marry wiz him, Jerry. He already
got big wife. I are see her. She are so big as
Jinx, and she smile on me very kind, and say
she have hear of me from her hosban', that
I am very lonely girl from Japan, and thas
very sad for me, and she goin' to take those
ride wiz me also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hm!&quot; Jerry felt ashamed of himself, but
he did not propose to reveal it, especially when
that little hand had crept back to its old place
on his knee, and the diamond flaunted brazenly
before his gaze. Nobody but a &quot;fat-head&quot;
would buy a diamond of that size anyway,
was Jerry's opinion. There was something
extremely vulgar about diamonds. They
were not nearly as pretty as rubies or emeralds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
or even turquoise, and Jerry had never liked
them. Of course, Miss Falconer, like every
other girl, had to have her diamond, and Jerry
recalled with irritation how, as a sophomore,
he had purchased that first diamond. He
neither enjoyed the expedition nor the memory
of it. Jinx's brazen ring made him think
of Miss Falconer's. However, the thought
of Miss Falconer was, for some reason or
other, distasteful to Jerry in these days, and,
moreover, the girl before him called for his full
attention as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you decided on Jinx, did you? Bobs
and Monty in the discard and the affluent fat
and fair Jinx the winner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, I are <i>prefer</i> marry all my friends,
but I say 'no' to each one of those.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you wearing Jinx's ring for
then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bi-cause it are loog nize on my hands, and
he <i>ask</i> me wear it there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">New emotions were flooding over the contrite
Jerry. Something was racing like
champagne through his veins, and he suddenly
realised how &quot;damnably jolly&quot; life was after
all. Still, even though Sunny had admitted
that no engagement existed between her and
Jinx, there was that ring. Poor little girl! A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
fellow had to teach her all of the western conventions,
she was that innocent and simple.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, you don't want to wear a fellow's
ring unless you intend to marry him, don't you
understand that? The ring means that you
are promised to him, do you get me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! But I <i>are</i> promise to Jinx. I are
promise that I will consider marry him some
day if I do not marry some other man I <i>wan'</i>
ask me also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Another man. Who&mdash;&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny's glance directed full upon him left
nothing to the imagination. Jerry's heart began
to thump in a manner that alarmed him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry,&quot; said Sunny, &quot;I going to wear
Jinx's ring <i>until</i> that man also asking me. I
<i>wan</i> him do so, bi-cause I are lig' him mos' bes'
of all my frien'. I think&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She had both
of her hands on his knees now, and was leaning
up looking so wistfully into his face that he
tried to avert his own gaze. In spite of the
lump that rose in his throat, in spite of the
frantic beating of his heart, Jerry did not ask
the question that the girl was waiting to hear.
After a moment, she said gently:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, Hatty are tell me that nex' year
he are come a Leap. Then, he say, thas perlite
for girl ask man make marriage wiz her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
Jerry, <i>I</i> are goin' to wait till those year of
Leap are come, and then, me? I are goin' ask
<i>you</i> those question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For one thrilling moment there was a great
glow in the heart of Jerry Hammond, and
then his face seemed suddenly to turn grey
and old. His voice was husky and there was
a mist before his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, I must tell you&mdash;Sunny, I&mdash;I&mdash;am
already engaged to be married to an American
girl&mdash;a girl my people want me to marry.
I've been engaged to her since my eighteenth
year. I&mdash;<i>don't</i> look at me like that, Sunny,
or&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl's head dropped to the level of the
floor, her hands slipping helplessly from his
knees. She seemed all in a moment to become
purely Japanese. There was that in her bowed
head that was strangely reminiscent of some
old and vanished custom of her race. She did
not raise her head, even as she spoke:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wishin' you ten thousand year of joy.
Sayonara for this night.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Sunny had left him alone. Jerry felt the
inability to stir. He stared into the dying
embers of his fire with the look of one who
has seen a vision that has disappeared ere he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
could sense its full significance. It seemed
at that moment to Jerry as if everything desirable
and precious in life were within reach,
but he was unable to seize it. It was like his
dream of beauty, ever above, but beyond man's
power to completely touch. Sunny was like
that, as fragile, as elusive as beauty itself.
The thought of his having hurt Sunny tore
his heart. She had aroused in him every impulse
that was chivalrous. The longing to
guard and cherish her was paramount to all
other feelings. What was it Professor Barrowes
had warned him of? That he should refrain
from taking the bloom from the rose.
Had he, then, all unwittingly, injured little
Sunny?</p>

<p class="indent">Mechanically, Jerry went into the hall,
slowly put his hat on his head and passed out
into the street. He walked up and down 67th
Street and along Central Park West to 59th
Street, retracing his steps three times to the
studio building, and turning back again. His
mind was in a chaos, and he knew not what
to do. Only one clear purpose seemed to
push through the fog, the passionate determination
to care for Sunny. She came first
of all. Indeed she occupied the whole of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
thought. The claim of the girl who had waited
for him seven years seemed of minor importance
when compared with the claim of the girl
he loved. The disinclination to hurt another
had kept him from breaking an engagement
that had never been of his own desire, but
now Jerry knew there could be no more evasions.
The time had come when he must face
the issue squarely. His sense of honour demanded
that he make a clean breast of the
entire matter to Miss Falconer. He reached
this resolve while still walking on 59th Street.
It gave him no more than time to catch the
night train to Greenwich. As he stepped
aboard the train that was bearing him from
Sunny to Miss Falconer all of the fogs had
cleared from Jerry's mind. He was conscious
of an immense sense of relief. It seemed
strange to him that he had never taken this
step before. Judging the girl by himself, he
felt that he knew exactly what she would say
when with complete candour he should &quot;lay his
cards upon the table.&quot; He felt sure that she
was a good sport. He did not delude himself
with the idea that an engagement that had
been irksome to himself had been of any joy
to her. It was simply, so he told himself, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
mistake of their parents. They had planned
and worked this scheme, and into it they had
dumped these two young people at a psychological
moment.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIII</p>

<p class="indent">For two days Sunny waited for Jerry to
return. She was lonely and most unhappy,
but hers was a buoyant personality, and
withal her hurt she kept up a bright face
before her little world of that duplex studio.
In spite of the two nights when no sleep at
all came, and she lay through the long hours
trying vainly not to think of the wife of Jerry
Hammond, in the daytime she moved about
the small concerns of the apartment with a
smile of cheer and found a measure of comfort
in her pets.</p>

<p class="indent">It was all very well, however, to hug Itchy
passionately to her breast, and assure herself
that she had in her arms one true and loving
friend. Always she set the dog sadly down
again, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, liddle honourable dog, you are jos
liddle dog, thas all. How you can know whas
ache on my heart. I do nod lig' you more for
to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She fed Mr. and Mrs. Satsuma, and whistled
and sang to them. After all, a canary is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
a canary. Its bright, hard eye is blank and
cold. Even the goldfish, swimming to the
top of the honourable bowl, and picking the
crumb so cunningly from her finger, lost their
charm for her. Miss Spring Morning had
long since been vanished with severe Japanese
reproaches for his inhuman treatment of
Sunny's first friends, the honourable mice,
several of whose little bodies Sunny had confided
to a grave she herself had dug, with
tears that aroused the janitor gentleman's
sympathy, so that he permitted the interment
in the back yard.</p>

<p class="indent">The victrola, working incessantly the first
day, supplied merely noise. On the second
morning she banged the top impulsively down,
and cried at Caruso:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I do not wan' hear your honourable
voice to-day. Shut you up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Midway in an aria from &quot;Rigoletto&quot; the
golden voice was quenched.</p>

<p class="indent">She hovered about the telephone, and
several times lifted the receiver, with the idea
of calling one of her friends, but always she
rejected the impulse. Intuitively Sunny knew
that until the first pang of her refusal had
passed her friends were better away from
her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Little comfort was to be extracted from
Hatton, who was acting in a manner that
had Sunny not been so absorbed by her own
personal trouble would have caused her concern.
Hatton talked incessantly and feverishly
and with tears about his Missus, and
what she had driven him to, and of how a
poor man tries to do his duty in life, but women
were ever trouble makers, and it was only
&quot;yuman nature&quot; for a man to want a little
pleasure, and he, Hatton, had made this perfectly
clear to Mr. Hammond when he had
taken service with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A yuman being, miss,&quot; said Hatton, &quot;is
yuman, and that's all there is to it. Yuman
nature 'as certain 'ankerings and its against
yuman nature to gainsay them 'ankerings, if
you'll pardon me saying so, miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">However, he assured Sunny most earnestly
that he was fighting the Devil and all his
works, which was just what &quot;them 'ankerings&quot;
was, and he audibly muttered for her especial
hearing in proof of his assertion several times
through the day: &quot;Get thee be'ind me,
Satan.&quot; Satan being &quot;them 'ankerings,
miss.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In normal times Sunny's fun and cheer
would have been of invaluable assistance and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
diversion to Hatton. Indeed, his long
abstention was quite remarkable since she
had been there; but Sunny, affect cheer as she
might, could not hide from the sympathetic
Hatton's gaze the fact that she was most unhappy.
In fact, Sunny's sadness affected the
impressionable Hatton so that the second
morning he could stand it no longer, and disappeared
for several hours, to return, hiccoughing
cravenly, and explaining:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't 'elp it, miss. My 'eart haches
for you, and it ain't yuman nature to gainsay
the yuman 'eart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatton,&quot; said Sunny severely, &quot;I are smell
you on my nose. You are not smell good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pardon me, miss,&quot; said Hatton, beginning
to weep. &quot;Hi'm sadly ashamed of myself,
miss. If you'll pardon me, miss, I'll betake
myself to less 'appy regions than Mr. 'Ammond's
studio, miss, 'as it's my desire not to
'urt your sense of smell, miss. So if you'll
pardon me, I'll say good-bye, miss, 'oping
you'll be in a 'appier mood when next we
meet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For the rest of that day there was no further
sign from Hatton. Left thus alone in the
apartment, Sunny was sore put to find something
to distract her, for all the old diversions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
without Jerry, began to pall. She wished wistfully
that Jerry had not forbidden her to make
friends with other tenants in the house. She
felt the strange need of a friend at this hour.
There was one woman especially whom Sunny
would have liked to know better. She always
waved to Sunny in such a friendly way across
the court, and once she called across to her:
&quot;Do come over and see me. I want you to
see some of the sketches I have made of you
at the window.&quot; Sunny pointed the lady out
to Jerry, and that young man's face became
surprisingly inflamed and he ordered Sunny
so angrily not to continue an acquaintance
with her unknown friend, that the poor child
avoided going near the window for fear of
giving offence.</p>

<p class="indent">Also, there was a gentleman who came and
went periodically in the studio building, and
whose admiring looks had all but embraced
Sunny even before she scraped an acquaintance
with him. He did not live in this building,
but came very frequently to call upon
certain of the artists, including the lady across
the court. Like Jinx, he always wore a flower
in his buttonhole, but, unlike Jinx, his clothes
had a certain distinction that to the unsophisticated
Sunny seemed to spell the last word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
in style. She was especially fascinated by his
tan-coloured spats, and once, examining them
with earnest curiosity while waiting for the
elevator, her glance arose to his face, and she
met his all embracing smile with one of her
own engaging ones. This man was in fact a
well known dilettante and man about town, a
dabbler a bit himself in the arts, but a monument
of egotism. He had diligently built up
a reputation as a patron and connoisseur of
art.</p>

<p class="indent">One Sunday morning Sunny came in from
a little walk as far as the park, with Itchy.
In spite of an unexpectedly hard shower that
had fallen soon after she had left, she returned
smiling and perfectly dry; excited and delighted
moreover over the fortune that had befallen
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry!&quot; she cried as soon as she entered,
&quot;I are git jost to those corner, when down
him come those rain. So much blow! Futen
(the wind god) get very angery and blow me
quick up street, but the rain fall down jos'
lig' cloud are burst. Streets flow lig' grade
river. Me? I are run quick and come up on
steps of house, and there are five, ten other
people also stand on those step and keep him
dry. One gentleman he got beeg umberella.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
I feel sure that umberella it keep me dry. So
I smile on those mans&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>what</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I make a smile on him. Like these&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
Sunny illustrated innocently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you know better than to smile at
any man on the street?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was taken aback. The Japanese are
a smiling nation, and the interchange of smiles
among the sexes is not considered reprehensible;
certainly not in the class from which
Sunny had come.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Smile are not bad. He are kind thing,
Jerry. It make people feel happy, and it do
lots good on those worl'. When I smile on
thad gentlemen, he are smile ride bag on me
ad once, and he take me by those arm, and
say he bring me home all nize and dry. And,
Jerry, he say, he thing I am too nize piece&mdash;er&mdash;brick-brack&mdash;&quot;
bric-a-brac was a new
word for Sunny, but Jerry recognised what
she was trying to say&mdash;&quot;to git wet. So he give
me all those umberella. He bring me ride up
ad these door, and he say he come see me very
soon now as he lig' make sure I got good
healt'. He are a very kind gentleman, Jerry.
Here are his card.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry took the card, glared at it, and began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
panically walking up and down the apartment,
raging and roaring like an &quot;angery tiger,&quot; as
Sunny eloquently described him to herself, and
then flung around on her and read her such a
scorching lecture that the girl turned pale with
fright, and, as usual, the man was obliged to
swallow his steam before it was all exploded.</p>

<p class="indent">In parenthesis, it may be here added, that
the orders given by Jerry to that black boy
at the telephone desk, embraced such a diabolical
description of the injury that was destined
to befall him should the personage in question
ever step his foot across Jerry's threshold, that
Sambo, his eyes rolling, never failed to assure
the caller, who came very persistently thereafter,
that &quot;Dat young lady she am move
away, sah. Yes, sah, she am left this department.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It will be seen, therefore, that Sunny, a
stranger in a strange land, shut in alone in
a studio, religiously following the instructions
of Jerry to refrain from making acquaintances
with anyone about her, was in a truly sad state.
She started to houseclean, but stopped midway
in panic, recalling the Japanese superstition
that to clean or sweep a house when one of
the family is absent is to precipitate bad fortune
upon the house. So she got down all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
Jerry's clothes and piously pressed and
sponged them, as she had seen Hatton do,
being very careful this time to avoid her first
mistake in ironing. So earnestly had she applied
herself to ironing the crease in the front
of one of Jerry's trousers that first time that
a most disastrous accident was the result.
Jerry, wearing the pressed trousers especially
to please her, found himself on the street the
cynosure of all eyes as he manfully strode
along with a complete split down the front
of one of the legs, which the too ardent iron of
Sunny had scorched. Having brushed and
cleaned all of Jerry's clothes on this day, she
prepared her solitary lunch; but this she could
not eat. Thoughts of Jerry sharing with her
the accustomed meals was too much for the
imaginative Sunny, and pushing the rice away
from her, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I do nod lig' put food any more ad my
insides. I givin you to my friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The contents of her bowl were emptied into
the pail under the sink, which she kept always
so clean, for she still was under the delusion
that said pail helped to feed the janitor gentleman
and his family.</p>

<p class="indent">All of that afternoon hung heavily on her
hands, and she vainly sought something to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
interest her and divert her mind from the
thought of Jerry. She found herself unconsciously
listening for the bell, but, curiously
enough, all of that day neither the buzzer, the
telephone nor even the dumbwaiter rang. She
made a tour of exploration to Jerry's sacred
room, lovingly arranging his pieces on his
chiffonier, and washing her hands in some toilet
water that especially appealed to her. Then
she found the bottle of hair tonic. Sniffing
it, she decided it was very good, and, painfully,
Sunny deciphered the legend printed
on the outside, assuring a confiding hair world
that the miraculous contents had the power to
remove dandruff, invigorate, strengthen, force
growth on bald heads, cause to curl and in
every way improve and cause to shine the hair
of the fortunate user of the same.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thas very good stuff,&quot; said Sunny. &quot;He
do grade miracle on top those head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She decided to put the shampoo-tonic to
the test, and accordingly washed her hair in
Jerry's basin, making an excellent job of it.
Descending to the studio, she lit the fireplace,
and curled up on a big Navaho by the fire.
Wrapped in a gorgeous bathrobe belonging to
Jerry, Sunny proceeded to dry her hair.</p>

<p class="indent">While she was in the midst of this process,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
the telephone rang. Sambo at the desk announced
that visitors were ascending. Sunny
had no time to dress or even to put up her
hair, and when in response to the sharp bang
upon the knocker she opened the door she
revealed to the callers a vision that justified
their worst fears. Her hair unbound, shining
and springing out in lovely curling disorder
about her, wrapped about in the bright embroidered
bathrobe which the younger woman
recognised at once as her Christmas gift to her
fianc, the work, in fact, of her own hands,
Sunny was a spectacle to rob a rival of complete
hope and peace of mind. The cool fury
of unrequited love and jealousy in the breast
of the younger woman and the indignant anger
in that of the older was whipped at the sight
of Sunny into active and violent eruption.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing in my son's apartment?&quot;
demanded the mother of Jerry, raising
to her eyes what looked to Sunny like a
gold stick on which grew a pair of glasses,
and surveying with pronounced disapproval
the politely bowing though somewhat flurried
Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are live ad those house,&quot; said Sunny,
simply. &quot;This are my home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You live here, do you? Well, I would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
you know that I am the mother of the young
man whose life you are ruining, and this young
girl is his fiance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I am very glad make you 'quaintance,&quot;
said Sunny, seeking to hide behind a politeness
her shock at the discovery of the palpable
rudeness of these most barbarian ladies. It
was hard for her to admit that the ladies of
Jerry's household were not models of fine
manners, as she had fondly supposed, but on
the contrary bore faces that showed no trace of
the kind hearts which the girl from Japan had
been taught by her mother to associate always
with true gentility. The two women's eyes
met with that exclamatory expression which
says plainer than words:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of all the unbounded impudence, this is
the worst!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have been told,&quot; went on Mrs. Hammond
haughtily, &quot;that you are a foreigner&mdash;a Japanese.&quot;
She pronounced the word as if speaking
of something extremely repellent.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny bowed, with an attempted smile, that
faded away as Jerry's mother continued ruthlessly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You do not look like a Japanese to me,
unless you have been peroxiding your hair. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
my opinion you are just an ordinary everyday
bad girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny said very faintly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aexcuse me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned like a hurt thing unjustly punished
to the other woman, as if seeking help
there. It had been arranged between the two
women that Mrs. Hammond was to do the
talking. Miss Falconer was having her full
of that curious satisfaction some women take
in seeing in person one's rival. Her expression
far more moved Sunny than that of the
angry older woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one but a bad woman,&quot; went on Mrs.
Hammond, &quot;would live like this in a young
man's apartment, or allow him to support her,
or take money from him. Decent girls don't
do that sort of thing in America. You are old
enough to get out and earn for yourself an
honest living. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Or are you devoid of shame, you bad
creature?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sunny, with such a look that
Jerry's mother's frown relaxed somewhat: &quot;I
are ashame. I are sawry thad I are bad&mdash;woman.
Aexcuse me this time. I try do better.
I sawry I are&mdash;bad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was plainly a full and complete confession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
of wrong and its effect on the older
woman was to arouse a measure of the Hammond
compunction which always followed a
hasty judgment. For a moment Mrs. Hammond
considered the advisability of reading to
this girl a lecture that she had recently prepared
to deliver before an institution for the
welfare of such girls as she deemed Sunny to
be. However, her benevolent intention was
frustrated by Miss Falconer.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a Japanese proverb which says that
the tongue three inches long can kill a man
six feet tall, but the tongue of one's enemy
is not the worst thing to fear. The cold smile
of the young woman staring so steadily at
her had power to wound Sunny far more than
the lacerating tongue of the woman whom
she realised believed she was fighting in her
son's behalf. Very silken and soft was the
manner of Miss Falconer as insinuatingly
she brought Mrs. Hammond back to the object
of their call. She had used considerable tact
and strategy in arranging this call upon
Sunny, having in fact induced Jerry to remain
for at least a day or two in Greenwich,
&quot;to think matters over,&quot; and see &quot;whether
absence would not prove to him that what he
imagined to be love was nothing but one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
those common aberrations to which men who
lived in the east were said to be addicted.&quot;
Jerry, feeling that he should at least do this
for her, waited at Greenwich. Miss Falconer
had called in the able and belligerent aid of
his mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, dear&mdash;&mdash;&quot; She already called
Mrs. Hammond &quot;mother.&quot; &quot;Suppose&mdash;er&mdash;we
make a quick end to the matter. You know
what we are here for. Do let us finish and
get away. You know, dear, that I am not
used to this sort of thing, and really I'm beginning
to get a nervous headache.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Stiffened and upheld by the young woman
whom she had chosen as wife for her son, Mrs.
Hammond delivered the ultimatum.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young woman, I want you to pack your
things and clear out from my son's apartment
at once. No argument! No excuses!
If you do not realise the shamelessness of the
life you are leading, I have nothing further
to say; but I insist, insist most emphatically,
on your leaving my boy's apartment this instant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A key turned in the lock. Hatton, dusty
and bedraggled, his hat on one side of his head
and a cigarette twisting dejectedly in the
corner of his mouth, stumbled in at the door.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
He stood swaying and smiling at the ladies,
stuttering incoherent words of greeting and
apology.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;La-adiesh, beggin' y'r pardon, it's a pleasure
shee thish bright shpring day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Hammond, overwhelmed with shame
and grief over the revelation of the disreputable
inmates of her son's apartment, turned
her broad back upon Hatton. She recognised
that man. He was the man she and Jerry's
father had on more than one occasion begged
their son to be rid of. Oh! if only Jeremy
Hammond senior were here now!</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, having heard the verdict of banishment,
stood helplessly, like one who has received
a death sentence, knowing not which
way to turn. Hatton staggered up the stairs,
felt an uncertain course along the gallery
toward his room, and fell in a muddled heap
midway of the gallery.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, half blindly, scarcely conscious of
what she was doing, had moved with mechanical
obedience toward the door, when Mrs.
Hammond haughtily recalled her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You cannot go out on the street in that
outrageous fashion. Get your things, and do
your hair up decently. We will wait here till
you are ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And suppose you take that bathrobe off.
It doesn't belong to you,&quot; said Miss Falconer
cuttingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Take only what belongs to you,&quot; said Mrs.
Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny slowly climbed up to her room.
Everything appeared now strange and like a
queer dream to her. She could scarcely believe
that she was the same girl who but a
few days before had joyously flitted about the
pretty room, which showed evidence of her intensely
artistic and feminine hands. She
changed from the bathrobe to the blue suit
she had worn on the night she had arrived at
Jerry's studio. From a drawer she drew forth
the small package containing the last treasures
that her mother had placed in her hand.
Though she knew that Mrs. Hammond and
Miss Falconer were impatiently awaiting her
departure, she sat down at her desk and painfully
wrote her first letter to Jerry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry sama: How I thank you three and
four time for your kindness to me. I am sorry
I are not got money to pay you back for all
that same, but I will take nothing with me but
those clothes on my body. Only bad girls
take money from gentleman at this America.
I have hear that to-day, but I never know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
that before, or I would not do so. I have
pray to Amaterasu-oho-mikami, making
happy sunshine of your life. May you live
ten thousand year. Sayonara. Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She came out along the gallery, bearing her
mother's little package. Kneeling by the half-awake
but helpless Hatton she thrust the
letter into his hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-bye, kind Hatton,&quot; said Sunny. &quot;I
sawry I not see your face no more. I sawry
I are make all those trobble for you wiz those
gas stove an' those honourable mice. I never
do those ting again. I hope mebbe you
missus come home agin some day ad you.
Sayonara.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wh-wheer y're goin', Shunny. Whatsh
matter?&quot; Hatton tried vainly to raise himself.
He managed to pull himself a few paces
along, by holding to the gallery rails, but
sprawled heavily down on the floor. The indignant
voice of his master's mother ascended
from the stairs:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you do not control yourself, my good
man, I will be forced to call in outside aid and
have you incarcerated.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Downstairs, Sunny, unmindful of the waiting
women, ran by them into the kitchen.
From goldfish to canaries she turned, whispering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
softly: &quot;Sayonara my friends. I sawry
leaving you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was opening the window onto the fire-escape,
and Itchy with a howl of joy had
leaped into her arms, when Mrs. Hammond
and Miss Falconer, suspicious of something
underhand, appeared at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing, miss? What is that
you are taking?&quot; demanded Mrs. Hammond.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny turned, with her dog hugged up close
to her breast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are say good-bye to my liddle dog,&quot; she
said. &quot;Sayonara Itchy. The gods be good
unto you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She set the dog hastily back in the box,
against his most violent protests, and Itchy
immediately set up such a woeful howling and
baying as only a small mongrel dog who possesses
psychic qualities and senses the departure
of an adored one could be capable of.
Windows were thrown up and ejaculations
and protests emanated from tenants in the
court, but Sunny had clapped both hands over
her ears, and without a look back at her little
friend, and ignoring the two women, she ran
through the studio, and out of the front door.</p>

<p class="indent">After her departure a silence fell between
Miss Falconer and Mrs. Hammond. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
latter's face suddenly worked spasmodically,
and the strain of the day overtook Jerry's
mother. She sobbed unrestrainedly, mopping
up the tears that coursed down her face. Miss
Falconer fanned herself slowly, and with an
absence of her usual solicitude for her prospective
mother-in-law, she refrained from
offering sympathy to the older woman, who
presently said in a muffled voice:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Stella, I am afraid that we may have
done a wrong act. It's possible that we have
made a mistake about this girl. She seemed so
very young, and her face&mdash;it was not a bad
face, Stella&mdash;quite the contrary, now I think
of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I suppose that's the way you look at
it. Personally you can't expect me to feel any
sort of sympathy for a bad woman like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stella, I've been thinking that a girl who
would say good-bye to her dog like that cannot
be wholly bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard of murderers who trained
fleas,&quot; said Miss Falconer. Then, with a pretended yawn,
she added, &quot;But really we must
be going now? It's getting very dark out, and
I'm dining with the Westmores at seven. I
told Matthews we'd be through shortly. He's
at the curb now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span></p>

<p class="indent">She had picked up her gloves and was drawing
them smoothly on, when Mrs. Hammond
noticed the left hand was ringless.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, my dear, where is your ring?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you didn't suppose, did you, that I
was going to continue my engagement to
Jerry Hammond after what he told me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But our purpose in coming here&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>My</i> purpose was to make sure that if <i>I</i>
were not to have Jerry neither should she&mdash;that
Japanese doll!&quot; All the bottled-up venom
of the girl's nature came forth in that single
utterance. &quot;Do let us get away. Really I'm
bored to extinction.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You may go any time you choose, Miss
Falconer,&quot; said Jerry Hammond's mother.
&quot;I shall stay here till my son returns.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">It was less than half an hour later that
Jerry burst into the studio. He came in with
a rush, hurrying across the big room toward
the kitchen and calling aloud:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! Hi! Sunny! I'm back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So intent was he in discovering Sunny that
he did not see his mother, sitting in the darkened
room by the window. Through dim eyes
Mrs. Hammond had been staring into the
street, and listening to the nearby rumble of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
the Sixth Avenue elevated trains. Somehow
the roar of the elevated spelled to the woman
the cruelty and the power of the mighty city,
out into which she had driven the young girl,
whose eyes had entreated her like a little
wounded creature. The club woman thought
of her admonitions and speeches to the girls
she had professionally befriended, yet here,
put to a personal test, she had failed signally.</p>

<p class="indent">Her son was coming through the studio
again, calling up toward the gallery above:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi! Sunny, old scout, where are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned, with a start, as his mother called
his name. His first impulse of welcome halted
as he saw her face, and electrically there
flashed through Jerry a realisation of the
truth. His mother's presence there was connected
with Sunny's absence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, where is Sunny? What are you
doing here? Where is Sunny, I say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He shot the questions at her frantically.
Mrs. Hammond began to whimper, dabbing
at her face with her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For heaven's sake, answer me. What have
you done with Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, how can I tell you? Jerry&mdash;Miss
Falcon-er and I&mdash;we&mdash;we thought it was
for your good. I didn't realise that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
c-cared so much about her, and I&mdash;and we&mdash;&mdash;Oh-h-h,&quot;
she broke down, crying uncontrolledly,
&quot;we have driven that poor little girl out&mdash;into
the street.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You what? What is that you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stared at his mother with a look of
loathing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, I thought&mdash;we thought her bad and
we&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bad! <i>Sunny!</i> Bad! She didn't know
what the word meant. My <i>God</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He leaped up the stairs, calling the girl's
name aloud, as if to satisfy himself that his
mother's story was false, but her empty room
told its own tale, and half way across the
gallery he came upon Hatton. He kicked the
valet awake, and the latter raised up, stuttering
and blubbering, and extending with shaking
hand the letter Sunny had left. The
words leaped up at him and smote him to the
soul. He did not see his mother. He did
not hear her cries, imploring him not to go
out like that. Blindly, his heart on fire, Jerry
Hammond dashed out from his studio, and
plunged into the darkening street, to begin his
search for the lost Sunny, who had disappeared
into that maelstrom that is New York.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIV</p>

<p class="indent">Despite all that money and influence
could do to aid in the search of the missing
girl, no trace of Sunny had been found
since the day she passed through the door of
the studio apartment and disappeared into the
seething throngs under the Sixth Avenue elevated.</p>

<p class="indent">Every policeman in Manhattan, Brooklyn
and the Bronx; every private detective in the
country, and the police and authorities
throughout the country, aided in that search,
keen to earn the enormous rewards offered
by her friends. Jerry's entire fortune was at
the disposal of the department. Jinx had instructed
them to &quot;go the limit&quot; as far as he
was concerned. Bobs, his newspaper instinct
keyed up to the highest tension, saw in every
clue a promise of a solution, and &quot;covered&quot; the
disappearance day and night. Young Monty,
changed from the cheeriest interne at Bellevue
to the most pessimistic and gloomy, developed
a weird passion for the morgue, and spent
hours hovering about that ghastly part of the
hospital.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The four young men met each night at
Jerry's studio and cast up their barren results.
Jinx unashamedly and even noisily wept, the
big tears splashing down his no longer ruddy
cheeks. Jinx had honestly loved Sunny, and
her loss was the first serious grief of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">Monty hugged his head and ruminated over
the darkest possibilities. He had suggested to
the police that they drag certain parts of the
Hudson River, and was indignant when they
pointed out the impracticability of such a
thing. In the spring the great river was swollen
to its highest, and flowing along at a great
speed, it would have been impossible to find
what Monty suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry, of all her friends, had himself the
least under command. He was still nearly
crazed by the catastrophe, and unable to sleep
or rest, taking little or no nourishment, frantically
going from place to place, he returned
to his studio to pace up and down, as if half
demented.</p>

<p class="indent">Despite the fact that her son seemed
scarcely conscious of her existence, and practically
ignored her, Mrs. Hammond continued
to remain in the apartment. Overwhelmed by
remorse and anxiety for her son's health and
sanity she could not bring herself to leave,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
even though she knew at this time her act had
driven her son far away from her. A great
change was visible in the mother of Jerry.
For the first time, possibly, she acquired a
vague idea of what her son's work and life
meant to him, and her conscience smote her
when she realised how he had gone ahead with
no encouragement or sympathy from home.
On the contrary, she and his father had thrown
every obstacle in his way. Like many self-made
men, Jerry's father cherished the ambition
to perpetuate the business he had successfully
built up from what he always called &quot;a
shoestring.&quot; &quot;I started with just a shoestring,&quot;
Jerry's father was wont to say, &quot;and
what's more, <i>I</i> didn't have any education to
speak of, yet I beat in the race most of the
college bred bunch.&quot; However, his parents had
had great faith in the change that would come
to Jerry after matrimony, and Miss Falconer,
being a daughter of Hammond, Sr.'s, partner,
the prospects up to this time had not been
without hope.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, Jerry's mother, away from the somewhat
overpowering influence of his father,
was seeing a new light. Many a tear she
dropped upon Jerry's sketch books, and she
suffered the pang of one who has had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
opportunity to help one she loved, and who
has withheld that sorely needed sympathy.
For the first time, too, Jerry's mother appreciated
his right to choose his own love. In
their anxiety to select for their son a suitable
wife, they had overlooked his own wishes in
the matter. Now Mrs. Hammond became
poignantly aware of his deep love for this
strange girl from Japan. She began to feel
an unconscious tenderness toward the absent
Sunny, and gradually became acquainted with
the girl's nature through the medium of the left
behind treasures and friends. Sunny's little
mongrel dog, the canaries, the gold fish, the
nailed up hole where she had fed the mice, her
friend the &quot;janitor gentleman,&quot; the black elevator
boy, the butcher gentleman, the policeman
on the beat who had never failed to return
Sunny's smiling greeting with a cheery &quot;Top
o' the morning to yourself, miss,&quot; Hatton&mdash;all
these revealed more plainly than words
could have told that hers was a sensitive and
rare nature. In Hatton's case, Mrs. Hammond
found a problem upon her hands. The
unfortunate valet blamed himself bitterly for
Sunny's going. He claimed that he had given
his solemn word of honour to Sunny, and had
broken that word, when he should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
there: &quot;Like a man, ma'am, hin the place of
Mr. 'Ammond, ma'am, to take care of Miss
Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Far from reproving the man, the conscience-stricken
Mrs. Hammond wept with him, and
asked timid questions about the absent one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Sunny was not an hordinary young
lady, begging your pardon, ma'am. She was
what the French would call distankey. She
was sweet and hinnercent as a baby lamb, hutterly
hunconscious of her hown beauty hand
charm. You wouldn't 'ave believed such hinnocence
possible in the present day, ma'am,
but Miss Sunny come from a race that's a bit
hignorant, ma'am, hand it wasn't her fault
that she didn't hunderstan' many of the proper
conventions of life. But she was perfectly
hinnocent and pure as a lily. Hanyone who
looked or spoke to 'er once would've seen that,
ma'am. It shone right hout of Miss Sunny's
heyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw it myself,&quot; said Mrs. Hammond, in
a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent">After a long, sniffling pause, Hatton said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Begging your pardon, ma'am, I'm thinking
that I don't deserve to work for Mr. 'Ammond
any longer, but I 'avent the 'eart to
speak to 'im at this time, and if you'll be so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
kind to hexplain things to 'im, I'll betake myself
to some hother abode.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My good man, I am sure that even Mr.
Jerry would not blame you. I am the sole
one at fault. I take the full blame. I
acknowledge it. I would not have you or anyone
else share my guilt, and, Hatton, I <i>want</i>
to be punished. Your conscience, I am sure,
is clear, but it would make us all very happy,
and I am sure it would make&mdash;Sunny.&quot; She
spoke the word hesitatingly&mdash;&quot;happy, too, if&mdash;if&mdash;well,
if, my good Hatton, you were to
turn over a new leaf, and sign the pledge.
Drink, I feel sure, is your worst enemy. You
must overcome it, Hatton, or it will overcome
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi will, ma'am. Hi'll do that. If you'll
pardon me now, Hi'll step right out and sign
the pledge. I know just where to go, if you'll
pardon me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hatton did know just where to go. He
crossed the park to the east side and came to
the brightly lighted Salvation Army barracks.
A meeting was in progress, and a fiery
tongued young woman was exhorting all the
sinners of the world to come to glory. Hatton
was fascinated by the groans and loud Amens
that came from that chorus of human wreckage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
Pushing nearer to the front, he came
under the penetrating eye of the Salvation
captain. She hailed him as a &quot;brother,&quot; and
there was something so unswervingly pure in
her direct gaze that it had the effect of magnetising
Hatton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Brother,&quot; said the Salvation captain, &quot;are
you saved?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, ma'am,&quot; said the unhappy Hatton,
&quot;but begging your pardon, if it haren't hout
of horder, Hi'd like to be taking the pledge,
ma'am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing is out of order where a human soul
is at stake,&quot; said the woman, smiling in an exalted
way. &quot;Lift up your hand, my brother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Hatton lifted his shaking hand, and, word
for word, he repeated the pledge after the
Salvation captain. Nor was there one in that
room who found aught to laugh at in the words
of Hatton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi promise, with God's 'elp,&quot; said Hatton,
&quot;to habstain from the use of halcoholic liquors
as a beverage, from chewing tobaccer or speaking
profane and himpure languidge.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Having thus spoken, Hatton felt a glow of
relief and a sense of transfiguration. He experienced,
in fact, that hysterical exhilaration
that &quot;converts&quot; feel, as if suddenly he were reborn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
and had come out of the mud into the
clean air. At such moments martyrs, heroes
and saints are made. Hatton, the automaton-like
valet of the duplex studio, with his
&quot;yuman 'ankerings&quot; was afire with a true
spiritual fervour. We leave him then marching
forth from the barracks with the Salvation
Army, his head thrown up, and singing loudly
of glory.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">On the third day after the disappearance of
Sunny, Professor Timothy Barrowes arrived
in New York City with the dinornis skeleton
of the quaternary period, dug up from the clay
of the Red Deer cliffs of Canada. This
precious find was duly transported to the
Museum of Natural History, where it was set
up by the skilled hands of college workmen,
who were zealots even as the little man who
nagged and adjured them as he had the excavators
on the Red Deer River. So absorbed,
in fact, was Professor Barrowes by his fascinating
employment, that he left his beloved
fossil only when the pressing necessity of further
funds from his friend and financial agent
(Jerry had raised the money to finance the
dinornis) necessitated his calling upon Jerry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
Hammond, who had made no response to his
latter telegrams and letters.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly Professor Barrowes wended
his way from the museum to Jerry's studio.
Here, enthused and happy over the success of
his trip, he failed to notice the abnormal
condition of Jerry, whose listless hot hand
dropped from his, and whose eye went roving
absently above the head of his volubly chattering
friend. It was only after the restless
and continued pacing of the miserable Jerry
and the failure to respond to questions put to
him continued for some time, that Professor
Barrowes was suddenly apprized that all was
not well with his friend. He stopped midway
in a long speech in which words like Mesozoic,
Triassic and Jurassic prevailed and snapped
his glasses suddenly upon his nose. Through
these he scrutinised the perturbed and oblivious
Jerry scientifically. The glasses were
blinked off. Professor Barrowes seized the
young man by the arm and stopped him as he
started to cross the room for possibly the fiftieth
time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come! Come! What is it? What is the
trouble, lad?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry turned his bloodshot eyes upon his old
teacher. His unshaven, haggard face, twitching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
from the effects of his acute nearness to
nervous prostration, startled Professor Barrowes.
Lack of sleep, refusal of nourishment,
the ceaseless search, the agonising fear and
anguished longing took their full toll from the
unhappy Jerry, but as his glance met the firm
one of his friend, a tortured cry broke from his
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, for God's sake, Professor Barrowes,
why did you not come when I asked you to?
Sunny&mdash;<i>Oh, my God!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes had Jerry's hand
gripped closely in his own, and the disjointed
story came out at last.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny had come! Sunny had gone! He
loved Sunny! He could not live without
Sunny&mdash;but Sunny had gone! They had
turned her out into the streets&mdash;his own
mother and Miss Falconer.</p>

<p class="indent">For the first time, it may be said, since his
discovery of the famous fossil of the Red Deer
River, Professor Barrowes's mind left his beloved
dinornis. He came back solidly to earth,
shot back by the calling need of Jerry. Now
the man of science was wide awake, and an
upheaval was taking place within him. The
words of his first telegram to Jerry rattled
through his head just then: &quot;The dinornis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
more important than Sunny.&quot; Now as he
looked down on the bowed head of the boy for
whom he cherished almost a father's love, Professor
Barrowes knew that all the dried-up
fossils of all the ages were as a handful of
worthless dust as compared with this single
living girl.</p>

<p class="indent">By main force Professor Barrowes made
Jerry lie down on that couch, and himself
served him the food humbly prepared by his
heartbroken mother, who told Jerry's friend
with a quivering lip that she felt sure he would
not wish to take it from his mother's hands.</p>

<p class="indent">There was no going out for Jerry on that
night. His protestations fell on deaf ears,
and as a further precaution, Professor Barrowes
secured possession of the key of the
apartment. Only when the professor pointed
out to him the fact that a breakdown on his
part would mean the cessation of his search
would Jerry finally submit to the older man
taking his place temporarily. And so, at the
telephone, which rang constantly all of that
evening, Professor Barrowes took command.
A thousand clues were everlastingly turning
up. These were turned over to Jinx and Bobs,
the former flying from one part of the city
and country to another in his big car, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
latter, with an army of newspaper men helping
him, and given full license by his paper,
influenced by the elder Hammond and Potter.
Finally, Professor Barrowes, having given
certain instructions to turn telephone calls
over to Monty in Bobs' apartment, sat down
to Jerry's disordered work table, and, glasses
perched on the end of his nose, he sorted out
the mail. The afternoon letters still lay unopened,
tossed down in despair by Jerry, when
he failed to find that characteristic writing that
he knew was Sunny's.</p>

<p class="indent">But now Professor Barrowes' head had
suddenly jerked forward. His chin came out
curiously, and his eyes blinked in amazement
behind his glasses. He set them on firmer,
fiercely, and slowly reread that two-line
epistle. The hand holding the paper shook,
but the eyes behind the glasses were bright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry&mdash;come hither, young man!&quot; he
growled, his dry old face quivering up with
something that looked comically like a smile
glaring through threatened tears. &quot;Read
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Across the table Jerry reached over and
took the letter from the famous steel magnate
of New York. He read it slowly, dully, and
then with a sense as of something breaking in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
his head and heart. Every word of those two
lines sank like balm into his comprehension
and consciousness. Then it seemed that a
surge of blood rushed through his being, blinding
him. The world rocked for Jerry Hammond.
He saw a single star gleaming in a
firmament that was all black. Down into immeasurable
depths of space sank Jerry Hammond.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XV</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, after she left Jerry's apartment,
might be likened to a little wounded wild
thing, who has trailed off with broken wing.
She had never consciously committed a wrong
act. Motherless, worse than fatherless, young,
innocent, lovely, how should she fare in a land
whose ways were as foreign to that from which
she had come as if she had been transplanted
to a new planet.</p>

<p class="indent">As she turned into Sixth Avenue, under the
roaring elevated structure, with its overloaded
trains, crammed with the home-going workers
of New York, she had no sense of direction
and no clear purpose in mind. All she felt
was that numb sense of pain at her heart and
the impulse to get as far away as possible from
the man she loved. Swept along by a moving,
seething throng that pressed and pushed
and shoved and elbowed by her, Sunny had a
sick sense of home longing, an inexpressible
yearning to escape from all this turmoil and
noise, this mad rushing and pushing and panting
through life that seemed to spell America.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
She sensed the fact that she was in the Land
of Barbarians, where everyone was racing and
leaping and screaming in an hysteria of speed.
Noise, noise, incessant noise and movement&mdash;that
was America! No one stopped to think;
no polite words were uttered to the stranger.
It was all a chaos, a madhouse, wherein dark
figures rushed by like shadows in the night
and little children played in the mud of the
streets.</p>

<p class="indent">The charming, laughing, pretty days in the
shelter of the studio of her friend had passed
into this nightmare of the Sixth Avenue noise,
where all seemed ugly, cruel and sinister. Life
in America was not the charming kindly thing
Sunny had supposed. Beauty indeed she had
brought in her heart with her, and that, though
she knew it not, was why she had seen only
the beautiful; but now, even for her, it had all
changed. She had looked into faces full of
hatred and malice; she had listened to words
that whipped worse than the lash of Hirata.</p>

<p class="indent">As she went along that noisy, crowded avenue,
there came, like a breath of spring, a
poignant lovely memory of the home she had
left. Like a vision, the girl saw wide spaces,
little blue houses with pink roofs and the
lower floor open to the refreshing breezes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
of the spring. For it was springtime in Japan
just as it was in New York, and Sunny knew
that the trees would be freighted with a glorified
frost of pink and white blossoms. The
wistaria vines would hang in purple glory to
peer at their faces in the crystal pools. The
fluttering sleeves of the happy picnickers
threading through lanes of long slender bamboos.
The lotus in the ponds would soon open
their white fingers to the sun. Rosy cheeked
children would laugh at Sunny and pelt her
with flower petals, and she would call back to
them, and toss her fragrant petals back.</p>

<p class="indent">It was strange as she went along that dirty
way that her mind escaped from what was
before and on all sides of her, and went out
across the sea. She saw no longer the passing
throngs. In imagination the girl from Japan
looked up a hill slope on which a temple shone.
Its peaks were twisted and the tower of the
pagoda seemed ablaze with gold. Countless
steps led upward to the pagoda, but midway
of the steps there was a classic Torrii, in which
was a small shrine. Here on a pedestal,
smiling down upon the kneeling penitents,
Kuonnon, the Goddess of Mercy, stood. To
Her now, in the streets of the American City,
the girl of Japan sent out her petition.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Kuonnon, sweet Lady of Mercy, permit
the spirit of my honourable mother to
walk with me through these dark and noisy
streets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The shining Goddess of Mercy, trailing her
robes among the million stars in the heavens
above, surely heard that tiny petition, for certain
it is that something warm and comforting
swept over the breast of the tired Sunny. We
know that faith will &quot;remove mountains.&quot;
Sunny's faith in her mother's spirit caused her
to feel assured that it walked by her side. The
Japanese believe that we can think our dead
alive, and if we are pure and worthy, we may
indeed recall them.</p>

<p class="indent">It came to pass, that after many hours, during
which she walked from 67th Street to
125th, and from the west to the east side of
that avenue, that she stopped before a brightly
lighted window, within which cakes and confections
were enticingly displayed, and from
the cellar of which warm odours of cooking
were wafted to the famished girl. Sunny's
youth and buoyant health responded to that
claim. Her feet, in the unaccustomed American
shoes&mdash;in Japan she had worn only sandals
and clogs&mdash;were sore and extremely weary
from the long walk, and a sense of intense exhaustion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
added to that pang of emptiness
within.</p>

<p class="indent">By the baker's window, therefore, on the
dingy Third Avenue of the upper east side,
leaned Sunny, staring in hungrily at the food
so near and yet so far away. She asked herself
in her quaint way:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I are now to do? My honourable insides
are ask for food.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She answered her own question at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will ask the advice of first person I meet.
He will tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The streets were in a semi-deserted condition,
such as follows after the home-going
throngs have been tucked away into their respective
abodes. There was a cessation of
traffic, only the passing of the trains overhead
breaking the hush of early night that comes
even in the City of New York. It was now
fifteen minutes to nine, and Sunny had had
nothing to eat since her scant breakfast.</p>

<p class="indent">Kuonnon, her mother's spirit, providence&mdash;call
it what we may&mdash;suffered it that the first
person whom Sunny was destined to meet
should be Katy Clarry, a product of the teeming
east side, a shop girl by trade. She was
crossing the street, with her few small packages,
revealing her pitiful night marketing at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
adjacent small shops, when Sunny accosted
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aexcuse me. I lig' ask you question,
please,&quot; said Sunny with timid politeness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uh-h-h?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Clarry, her grey, clear eye sweeping
the face of Sunny in one comprehensive glance
that took her &quot;number,&quot; stopped short at the
curb, and waited for the question.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are hungry,&quot; said Sunny simply, &quot;and I
have no money and no house in which to sleep
these night. What I can do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee!&quot; Katy's grey eyes flew wider. The
girl before her seemed as far from being a
beggar as anyone the east side girl had ever
seen. Something in the wistful, lovely face
looking at her in the dark street tightened
that cord that was all mother in the breast of
Katy Clarry. After a moment:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you stone broke then? Out of work?
You don't look's if you could buck up against
tough luck. What you doin' on the streets?
You ain't&mdash;&mdash;? No, you ain't. I needn't
insult you by askin' that. Where's your home,
girl?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I got no home,&quot; said Sunny, in a very faint
voice. A subtle feeling was stealing over the
tired Sunny, and the whiteness of her cheeks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
the drooping of her eyes, apprized Katy of her
condition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, don't be fallin' whatever you do. You
don't want no cop to get 'is hands on you. You
come along with me. I ain't got much, but
you're welcome to share what I got. I'll stake
you till you get a job. Heh! Get a grip on
yourself. There! That's better. Hold on to
me. I'll put them packages under this arm.
We ain't got far to walk. Steady now. We
don't want no cop to say we're full, because
we ain't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy led the trembling Sunny along the
dirty, dingy avenue to one of those melancholy
side streets of the upper east side. They
came to a house whose sad exterior proclaimed
what was within. Here Katy applied her
latch key, and in the dark and odorous halls
they found their way up four flights of stairs.
Katy's room was at the far end of a long bare
hall, and its dimensions were little more than
the shining kitchenette of the studio apartment.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy struck a match, lit a kerosene lamp,
and attached to the one half-plugged gas jet
a tube at the end of which was a one-burner
gas stove. Sunny, sitting helplessly on the
bed, was too dazed and weary to hold her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
position for long, and at Katy's sharp: &quot;Heh,
there! lie down,&quot; she subsided back upon the
bed, sighing with relief as her exhausted body
felt the comfort of Katy's hard little bed.
From sundry places Katy drew forth a frying
pan, a pitcher of water, a tiny kettle and
a teapot. She put two knives and forks and
spoons on the table, two cracked plates and
two cups. She peeled a single potato, and
added it to the two frankfurters frying on
the pan. She chattered along as she worked,
partly to hide her own feelings, and partly to
set the girl at her ease. But indeed Sunny
was far from feeling an embarrassment such
as Katy in her place might have felt. The
world is full of two kinds of people; those who
serve, and those who are served, and to the
latter family Sunny belonged. Not the lazy,
wilful parasites of life, but the helpless children,
whom we love to care for. Katy, glancing
with a maternal eye, ever and anon at the
so sad and lovely face upon her pillow was
curiously touched and animated with a desire
to help her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're dog-tired, ain't you? How long
you been out of work? I always feel more
tired when I'm out o' work and looking for a
job, than when I got one, though it ain't my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
idea of a rest exactly to stand on your feet
all day long shoving out things you can't
afford to have yourself to folks who mostly
just want to look 'em over. Some of them
shoppers love to come in just about closin'
hour. They should worry whether the girl
behind the counter gets extra pay for overtime
or if she's suffering from female weaknesses
or not. Of course, if I get into one of
them big stores downtown, I can give a customer
the laugh when the dingdong sounds
for closin', but you can't do no such thing in
Harlem. We're still in the pioneer stage up
here. I expect you're more used to the Fifth
Avenue joints. You look it, but, say, I never
got a look in at one of them jobs. They
favour educated girls, and I ain't packed with
learning, I'm telling the world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You loog good to me,&quot;&mdash;a favourite expression
of Jerry's, and something in her accent
and the earnestness with which she said
it warmed Katy, who laughed and said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, go on. I ain't much on looks neither.
There, now. Draw up. All&mdash;l-ler <i>ready</i>!
Dinner is served. Stay where you are on the
bed. Drop your feet over. I ain't got but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
one chair, and I'll have it meself, thank you,
don't mention it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy pushed the table beside the bed, drew
her own chair to the other side, set the kettle
on the jet which the frying pan had released
and proudly surveyed her labour.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not much, but looks pretty good to me.
If there's one thing I love it is a hot dog.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put on Sunny's plate the largest of the
two frankfurters and three-quarters of the
potato, cut her a generous slice of bread and
poured most of the gravy on her plate, saying:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always say sausage gravy beats anything
in the butter line. Tea'll be done in a minute,
dearie. Ain't got but one burner. Gee! I
wisht I had one of them two deckers that you
can cook a whole meal at once with. Ever
seen 'em? How's your dog?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dog?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Frankfurter&mdash;weeny, or in polite speech,
sausage, dearie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How it is good,&quot; said Sunny with simple
eloquence. &quot;I thang you how much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't mention it. You're welcome.
You'd do the same for me if I was busted. I
always say one working girl should stake the
other when the other is out of work and broke.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
There's unity in strength,&quot; quoted Katy with
conviction. &quot;Have some more&mdash;do! Dip
your bread in the gravy. Pretty good, ain't
it, if I do say it who shouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It mos' nices' food I are ever taste,&quot; declared
Sunny earnestly.</p>

<p class="indent">While the tea was going into the cups:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My name's Katy Clarry. What's yours?&quot;
asked Katy, a sense of well-being and good
humour toward the world flooding her warm
being.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! That's a queer name. Gee! ain't
it pretty? What's your other name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sindicutt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sounds kind o' foreign. What are you,
anyway? You ain't American&mdash;at least you
don't look it or talk it, though heaven knows
anything and everything calls itself American
to-day,&quot; said the native-born American
girl with scorn. &quot;Meaning no offence, you
understand, but&mdash;well&mdash;you just don't look
like the rest of us. You ain't a Dago or a
Sheeny. I can see that, and you ain't a Hun
neither. Are you a Frenchy? You got queer
kind of eyes&mdash;meaning no offence, for personally
I think them lovely, I really do. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
seen actresses with no better eyes than you
got.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy shot her questions at Sunny, without
waiting for an answer. Sunny smiled sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, I are sawry thad I am not be American
girl. I are born ad Japan&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You</i> ain't no Chink. You can't tell me no
such thing as that. I wasn't born yesterday.
What are you, anyway? Where do you come
from? Are you a royal princess in disguise?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The latter question was put jocularly, but
Katy in her imaginative way was beginning
to question whether her guest might not in
fact be some such personage. An ardent
reader of the yellow press, by inheritance a
romantic dreamer, in happier circumstances
Katy might have made a place for herself in
the artistic world. Her sordid life had been
ever glorified by her extravagant dreams in
which she moved as a princess in a realm
where princes and lord and kings and dukes
abounded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I are not princess,&quot; said Sunny sadly.
&quot;I not all Japanese, Katy, jos liddle bit. Me?
I got three kind of blood on my insides. I
sawry thad my ancestors put them there. I
are Japanese and Russian and American.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! You're what we call a mongrel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
Meaning no offence. You can't help yourself.
Personally I stand up first for the home-made
American article but I ain't got no prejudice
against no one. And anyway, you can <i>grow</i>
into an American if you want to. Now we
women have got the francheese, we got the
right to vote and be nachelised too if we want
to. So even if you have a yellow streak in
you&mdash;and looking at you, I'd say it was gold
moren't yellow&mdash;you needn't tell no one about
it. No one'll be the wiser. You can trust me
not to open my mouth to a living soul about
it. What you've confided in me about being
partly Chink is just as if you had put the inflammation
in a tomb. And it ain't going to
make the least bit of difference between us.
Try one of them Uneeda crackers. Sop it in
your tea now you're done with your gravy.
Pretty good, ain't it? I'll say it is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, to-night I are going to tell you some
things about me, bi-cause I know you are my
good frien' now forever. I lig' your kind eye,
Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on! You're kiddin' me, Sunny. If I
had eyes like yours, it'd be a different matter.
But I'm stuck on the idea of having you for a
friend just the same. I ain't had a chum since
I don't know when. If you knew what them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
girls was like in Bamberger's&mdash;well, I'm not
talkin' about no one behind their backs, but,
say&mdash;Sunny, I could tell you a thing or two'd
make your hair stand on end. And as for
tellin' me about your own past, say if you'll
tell me yours, I'll tell you mine. I always say
that every girl has some tradgedy or other in
her life. Mine began on the lower east side.
I graduated up here, Sunny. It ain't nothing
to brag about, but it's heaven compared with
what's downtown. I used to live in that
gutter part of the town where God's good air
is even begrudged you, and where all the dirty
forriners and chinks&mdash;meanin' no offence,
dearie, and I'll say for the Chinks, that compared
with some of them Russian Jews&mdash;Gee!
you're Russian too, ain't you, but I don't
mean no offence! Take it from me, Sunny,
some of them east side forriners&mdash;I'll call
them just that to avoid givin' offence&mdash;are
just exactly like lice, and the smells down
there&mdash;Gee! the stock yards is a flower garden
compared with it. Well, we come over&mdash;my
folks did&mdash;I was born there&mdash;I'm a real
American, Sunny. Look me over. It won't
hurt your eyes none. My folks come over
from Ireland. My mother often told me that
they thought the streets of New York were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
just running with gold, before they come out.
That simple they were, Sunny. But the gold
was nothing but plain, rotten dust. It got
into the lungs and the spine of them all.
Father went first. Then mother. Lord only
knows how they got it&mdash;doctor said it was from
the streets, germs that someone maybe dumped
out and come flyin' up into our place that was
the only clean spot in the tenement house, I'll
say that for my mother. There was two kids
left besides me. I was the oldes' and not much
on age at that, but I got me a job chasin'
around for a millinery shop, and I did my best
by the kids when I got home nights; but the
cards was all stacked against me, Sunny, and
when that infantile parallysus come on the
city, the first to be took was my k-kid brother,
and me li-little s-sister she come down with it
too and&mdash;Ah-h-h-h!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy's head went down on the table, and she
sobbed tempestuously. Sunny, unable to
speak the words of comfort that welled up in
her heart, could only put her arms around
Katy, and mingle her tears with hers. Katy
removed a handkerchief from the top of her
waist, dabbed her eyes fiercely, shared the little
ball with Sunny, and then thrust it down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
neck of her waist again. Bravely she smiled
at Sunny again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There yoh got the story of the Clarry's
of the east side of New York, late of Limerick,
Ireland. You can't beat it for&mdash;for tradgedy,
now can you? So spiel away at your own
story, Sunny. I'm thinkin' you'll have a hard
time handin' me out a worse one than me own.
Don't spare me, kid. I'm braced for anything
in this r-rotten world.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVI</p>

<p class="indent">It was well for Sunny that her new friend
was endowed with a generous and belligerent
nature. Having secured for Sunny a
position at the Bamberger Emporium, Katy's
loyalty to her friend was not dampened when
on the third day Sunny was summarily discharged.
Hands on hips, Katy flew furiously
to her brother's defence, and for the benefit of
her brother and sister workers she relieved
herself loudly of all her pent-up rage of the
months. In true Union style, Katy marched
out with Sunny. The excuse for discharging
Sunny was that she did not write well enough
to fill out the sales slips properly. Nasty as
the true reason was, there is no occasion to
set forth the details here.</p>

<p class="indent">Suffice it to say that the two girls, both
rosy from excitement and wrath, arm and arm
marched independently forth from the Emporium,
Katy loudly asserting that she would
sue for her half week's pay, and Sunny
anxiously drawing her along, her breath coming
and going with the fright she had had.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee!&quot; snorted Katy, as they turned into
the street on which was the dingy house in
which they lived, &quot;it did my soul good to dump
its garbage on that pie-faced, soapy-eyed
monk. You don't know what I been through
since I worked for them people. You done
me a good turn this mornin' when you let out
that scream. I'd been expecting something
like that ever since he dirtied you with his eyes.
That's why I was hangin' around the office, in
spite of the ribbon sales, when you went in.
Well, here we are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here they were indeed, back in the small
ugly room of that fourth floor, sitting, the one
on the ricketty chair, and the other on the side
of the hard bed. But the eyes of youth are
veiled in sun and rose. They see nor feel
not the filth of the world. Sunny and Katy,
out of a job, with scarcely enough money between
them to keep body and soul together,
were yet able to laugh at each other and exchange
jokes over the position in which they
found themselves.</p>

<p class="indent">After they had &quot;chewed the rag,&quot; as Katy
expressively termed it, for awhile, that brisk
young person removed her hat, rolled up her
sleeves, and declared she would do the &quot;family
wash.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's too late now,&quot; said Katy, &quot;to job hunt
this morning. So I'll do the wash, and you
waltz over across the street and do the marketin'.
Here's ten cents, and get a wiggle on
you, because it's 10.30 now, and I got a plan
for us two. I'll tell you what it is. There
ain't no hurry. Just wait a bit, dearie. First
we'll have a bite to eat, though I'm not hungry
myself. I always say, though, you can
land a job better on a full than a empty
stomach. Well, lunch packed away in us, little
you and me trots downtown&mdash;not to no 125th
Street, mind you, but downtown, to Fifth
Avenoo, where the swell shops are, do you get
me? I'd a done this long ago, for they say
it's as easy to land on Fifth Avenoo as it is on
Third. It's like goods, Sunny. The real silk
is cheaper than the fake stuff, because it lasts
longer and is wider, but if one ain't got the
capital to invest in it in the first place, why
you just have to make the best of the imitation
cheese. If I could of dolled myself up
like them girls that hold down the jobs on
Fifth Avenoo, say, you can take it from me,
I'd a made some of them henna-haired ladies
look like thirty cents. Now <i>you</i> got the looks,
and you got the clothes too. That suit you're
wearin' don't look like no million dollars, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
it's got a kick to it just the same. The goods
is real. I been lookin' at it. Where'd you
get it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I get that suit ad Japan, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Japan! What are you givin' us? You
can't tell me no Chink ever made a suit like
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny nodded vigorously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Katy, Japanese tailor gentleman
make thad suit. He copy it from American
suit just same on lady at hotel, and he tell me
that he are just like twin suits.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I take off my hat to that Chink, though I
always have heard they was great on copying.
However, it's unmaterial who made it, and it
don't detract from its looks, and no one will
be the wiser that a Chink tailor made it. You
can trust me not to open my mouth. The
main thing is that that suit and your face&mdash;and
everything about you is going to make a
hit on Fifth Avenoo. You see how Bamberger
fell for you at the drop, and you could be there
still and have the best goin' if you was like
some ladies I know, though I'm not mentionin'
no names. I'm not that kind, Sunny.
Now, here's my scheme, and see if you can
beat it. Your face and suit'll land the jobs
for us. My brains'll hold 'em for us. Do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
get me? You'll accept a position&mdash;you don't
say job down there&mdash;only on condition that
they take your friend&mdash;that's me&mdash;too. Then
together we prove the truth of 'Unity being
strength.' We'll hang together. Said Lincoln&quot;
(Katy raised her head with true solemnity):
'&quot;Together we rise, divided we fall!'
Shake on that, Sunny.&quot; Shake they did.
&quot;Now you skedaddle off for that meat. Ask
for dog. It goes farther and is fillin'. Give
the butcher the soft look, and he'll give you
your money's worth&mdash;maybe throw in an extra
dog for luck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the butcher shop, Sunny, when her turn
came, favoured the plump gentleman behind
the counter to such an engaging smile that he
hurriedly glanced about him to see if the
female part of his establishment were around.
The coast clear, he returned the smile with interest.
Leaning gracefully upon the long
bloody butcher knife in one hand, the other
toying with a juicy sirloin, he solicited the
patronage of the smiling Sunny. She put her
ten cents down, and continuing the smile, said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Please you give me plenty dog meat for
those money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surest thing,&quot; said the flattered butcher.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
&quot;I got a pile just waitin' for a customer like
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He disappeared into a hole in the floor, and
returned up the ladder shortly, bearing an
extremely large package, which he handed
across to the surprised and overjoyed Sunny,
who cried:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I are thang you. How you are kind.
I thang you very moach. Good-aday!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It so happened that when Sunny had come
out of the house upon that momentous marketing
trip a pimply-faced youth was lolling
against the railing of the house next door. His
dress and general appearance made him conspicuous
in that street of mean and poverty-stricken
houses, for he wore the latest thing
in short pinch-back coats, tight trousers raised
well above silk-clad ankles, pointed and polished
tan shoes, a green tweed hat and a cane
and cigarette loosely hung in a loose mouth.
A harmless enough looking specimen of the
male family at first sight, yet one at which the
sophisticated members of the same sex would
give a keen glance and then turn away with
a scowl of aversion and rage. Society has
classified this type of parasite inadequately as
&quot;Cadet,&quot; but the neighbourhood in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
thrives designates him with one ugly and expressive
term.</p>

<p class="indent">As Sunny came out of the house and ran
lightly across the street, the youth wagged his
cigarette from the corner of one side of his
mouth to the other, squinted appraisingly at
the hurrying girl, and then followed her
across the street. Through the opened door
of the kosher butcher shop, he heard the transaction,
and noted the joy of Sunny as the
great package was transferred to her arms.
As she came out of the shop, hurrying to bear
the good news to Katy, she was stopped at the
curb by the man, his hat gracefully raised,
and a most ingratiating smile twisting his evil
face into a semblance of what might have appeared
attractive to an ignorant and weak
minded girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Levine. I
believe I met you at a friend's house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are mistake,&quot; said Sunny. &quot;My name
are not those. Good-a-day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He continued to walk by her side, murmuring
an apology for the mistake, and presently
as if just discovering the package she carried,
he affected concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Allow me to carry that for you. It's entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
too heavy for such pretty little arms as
yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thang you. I lig' better carry him myself,&quot;
said Sunny, holding tightly to her
precious package.</p>

<p class="indent">Still the pimpled faced young man persisted
at her side, and as they reached the curb, his
hand at her elbow, he assisted her to the sidewalk.
Standing at the foot of the front steps,
he practically barred her way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You live here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe I know Mrs. Munson, the lady
that keeps this house. Relative of yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I are got no relative.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All alone here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I got frien' live wiz me. Aexcuse me.
I are in hoarry eat my dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if I know your friend. What is
his name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His name are Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, don't hurry. I believe, now I think of
it, I know Katy. What's the matter with
your comin' along and havin' dinner with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thang you. My frien' are expect me eat
those dinner with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's all right. I have a friend too.
Bring Katy along, and we'll all go off for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
blowout. What do you say? A sweet little
girl like you don't need to be eatin' dog meat.
I know a swell place where we can get the best
kind of eats, a bit of booze to wash it down
and music and dancing enough to make you
dizzy. What do you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He smiled at Sunny in what he thought was
an irresistible and killing way. It revealed
three decayed teeth in front, and brought his
shifty eyes into full focus upon the shrinking
girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I go ask my frien',&quot; she said hurriedly.
&quot;Aexcuse me now. You are stand ad my
way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He moved unwillingly to let her pass.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surest thing. More the merrier. Let's go
up and get Katy. What floor you on?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I bring Katy down,&quot; said Sunny breathlessly,
and running by the pasty faced youth,
she opened the door, and closed it quickly behind
her, shooting the lock closed. She ran
up the stairs, as if pursued, and burst breathlessly
into the little room where Katy was
singing a ditty composed to another of her
name, and pasting her lately washed handkerchiefs
upon the window pane and mirror.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Beautiful K-Katy&mdash;luvully Katy!</span><br />
<span class="i4">You're the only one that ever I adore,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>

<span class="i4">I'll be w-waiting at the k-k-k-kitchen door!&quot;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>sang the light-hearted and valiant Katy
Clarry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Katy,&quot; cried Sunny breathlessly.
&quot;Here are those dog.&quot; She laid the huge
package before the amazed and incredulous
Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the love of Mike! Did Schmidt sell
you a whole cow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy tore the wrappings aside, and revealed
the contents of the package. An assortment
of bones of all sizes, large and small, a few
pieces of malodorous meat, livers, lights and
guts, and the insides of sundry chickens.
Katy sat down hard, exclaiming:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good night! What did you ask for?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ask him for dog meat,&quot; excitedly and indignantly
declared Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You got it! You poor simp. Heaven help
you. Never mind, there's no need now of crying
over spilled beans. It's too late now to
change, so here's where we kiss our lunch a
long and last farewell, and do some hustling
downtown.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Katy, I am thad sorry!&quot; cried Sunny
tragically.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all right, dearie. Don't you worry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
You can't help being ignorant. I ain't hungry
myself anyway, and you're welcome to the
cracker there. That'll do till we get back,
and then, why, I believe we can boil some of
them bones and get a good soup. I always say
soup is just as fillin' as anything else, especially
if you put a onion in it, and have a bit
of bread to sop it up with, and I got the onion
all right. So cheer up, we'll soon be dead and
the worst is yet to come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, there are a gentleman down on those
street, who are want give us nize dinner to
eat, with music and some danze. Me? I am
not care for those music, but I lig' eat those
dinner, and I lig' also thad you eat him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gentleman, huh?&quot; Katy's head cocked
alertly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, he speak at me on the street, and he
say he take me and my frien' out to nize dinner.
He are wait in those street now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy went to the window, leaned far out,
saw the man on the street, and drew swiftly
in, her face turning first white, then red.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, ain't you got any better sense than
speak to a man on the street?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, Katy, I din nod speag ad those man,&quot;
declared Sunny indignantly. &quot;He speag ad
me, and I do nod lig' hees eye. I do nod lig'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
hees mout', nor none of hees face, but I speag
perlite bi-cause he are ask me eat those dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you poor little simp, let me tell you
who <i>that</i> is. He's the dirtiest swine in Harlem.
You're muddied if he looks at you. He's&mdash;he's&mdash;I
can't tell you what he is, because
you're so ignorunt you wouldn't understand.
You and me go out with the likes of him!
Sa-ay, I'd rather duck into a sewer. I'd come
out cleaner, believe me. Now watch how little
K-k-k-katy treats that kind of dirt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She transferred the more decayed of the
meat and bones from the package to the pail
of water which had recently served for her
&quot;family wash.&quot; This she elevated to the window,
put her head out, and as if sweetly to
signal the waiting one below, she called:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hi-yi-yi-yi&mdash;i-i!&quot; and as the man below
looked up expectantly, she gave him the full
benefit of the pail's contents in his upturned
face.</p>

<p class="indent">The sight of the drenched, spluttering and
foully swearing rat on the street below struck
the funny side of the two young girls. Clinging
together, they burst into laughter, holding
their sides, and with their young heads tossed
back; but their laughter had an element of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
hysteria to it, and when at last they stopped,
and the stream of profanity from below continued
to pour into the room, Katy soberly
closed the window. For a while they stared
at each other in a scared silence. Then Katy,
squaring her shoulders, belligerently said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we should worry over that one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was standing now by the bureau.
A very thoughtful expression had come to
Sunny's face, and she opened the top drawer
and drew out her little package.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy,&quot; she said softly, &quot;here are some little
thing ad these package, which mebbe it goin'
to help us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, I been wonderin' what you got in that
parcel ever since you been here. I'd a asked
you, but as you didn't volunteer no inflamation,
I was too much of a lady to press it, and
I'm telling the world, I'd not open no package
the first time myself, without knowin' what
was in it, especially as that one looks kind of
mysteriees and foreign looking. I heard about
a lady named Pandora something and when
she come to open a box she hadn't no right to
open, it turned into smoke and she couldn't
get it back to where she wanted it to go. What
you got there, dearie, if it ain't being too personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
to ask? I'll bet you got gold and diamonds
hidden away somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was picking at the red silk cord.
Lovingly she unwrapped the Japanese paper.
The touch of her fingers on her mother's
things was a caress and had all the reverence
that the Japanese child pays in tribute to a
departed parent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These honourable things belong my
mother,&quot; said Sunny gently. &quot;She have give
them to me when she know she got die. See,
Katy, this are kakemona. It very old, mebbe
one tousan' year ole. It belong at grade
Prince of Satsuma. Thas my mother ancestor.
This kakemona, it are so ole as those
ancestor,&quot; said Sunny reverently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Old! Gee, I should say it is. Looks as if
it belonged in a tomb. You couldn't hock
nothing like that, dearie, meanin' no offence.
What else you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The poor simp!&quot; said Katy to herself, as
Sunny drew forth her mother's veil. In the
gardens of the House of a Thousand Joys
the face of the dancer behind the shimmering
veil had aroused the enthusiasm of her admirers.
Now Katy bit off the words that were
about to explain to Sunny that in her opinion
a better veil could be had at Dacy's for ninety-eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
cents. All she said, however, was:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You better keep the veil, Sunny. I know
how one feels about a mother's old duds. I
got a pair of shoes of my mother's that nothing
could buy from me, though they ain't much
to look at; but I know how you feel about them
things, dearie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This,&quot; said Sunny, with shining eyes, &quot;are
my mother's fan. See, Katy, Takamushi, a
grade poet ad Japan, are ride two poem on
thad fan and present him to my mother. Thad
is grade treasure. I do nod lig' to sell those
fan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn't. You just keep it, dearie. We
ain't so stone broke that you have to sell your
mother's fan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;These are flower that my mother wear ad
her hair when she danze, Katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The big artificial poppies that once had
flashed up on either side of the dancer's lovely
face, Sunny now pressed against her cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ain't they pretty?&quot; said Katy, pretending
an enthusiasm she did not feel. &quot;You could
trim a hat with them if flowers was in fashion
this year, but they ain't, dearie. The latest
thing is naked hats, sailors, like you got, or
treecornes, with nothing on them except the
lines. What's that you got there, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That are a letter, Katy. My mother gave
me those letter. She say that some day mebbe
I are need some frien'. Then I must put those
letter at post office box, or I must take those
letter in my hand to thad man it are write to.
He are frien' to me, my mother have said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy grabbed the letter, disbelieving her
eyes when she read the name inscribed in the
thin Japanese hand. It was addressed both
in English and Japanese, and the name was,
Stephen Holt Wainwright, 27 Broadway,
New York City.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Someone hold me up,&quot; cried Katy. &quot;I'm
about to faint dead away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Katy, do not be dead away! Oh, Katy,
do not do those faint. Here are those cracker.
I am not so hungry as you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My Lord! You poor ignorunt little simp,
don't you reckernise when a fellow is fainting
with pure unadulterated joy? How long have
you had that letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Four year now,&quot; said Sunny sadly, thinking
of the day when her mother had placed it
in her hand, and of the look on the face of
that mother.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why did you never mail it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was await, Katy. I are not need help.
I have four and five good frien' to me then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
and I do not need nuther one; but now I are
beggar again. I nod got those frien's no more.
I need those other one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Were you ever a <i>beggar</i>, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Katy, some time my mother and I
we beg for something eat at Japan. Thad is
no disgrace. The gods love those beggar jos'
same rich man, and when he go on long journey
to those Meido, mebbe rich man go behind
those beggar. I are hear thad at Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know who this letter is addressed
to, dearie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Katy, I cannot read so big a name.
My mother say he will be frien' to me always.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, I pity you for your ignorunce, but
I don't hold it against you. You was born
that way. Why, a child could read that name.
Goodness knows I never got beyond the Third
Grade, yet I <i>hope</i> I'm able to read that. It
says as plain as the nose on your face, Sunny:
Stephen Holt Wainwright. Now that's the
name of one of the biggest guns in the country.
He's a U. S. senator, or was and is, and
he's so rich that he has to hire twenty or fifty
cashiers to count his income that rolls in upon
him from his vast estates. If you weren't so
ignorunt, Sunny, you'd a read about him in
the <i>Journal</i>. Gee! his picture's in nearly every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span>
day, and pictures of his luxurious home and
yacht and horses and wife, who's one of the
big nobs in this suffrage scare. They call him
'The Man of Steel,' because he owns most of
the steel in the world, and because he's got a
mug&mdash;a face&mdash;on him like a steel trap. That's
what I've heard and read, though I've never
met the gentleman. I expect to, however, very
soon, seeing he's a friend of yours. And now,
lovey, don't waste no more tears over that other
bunch of ginks, because this Senator Wainwright
has got them all beat in the Marathon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, this letter are written by my mother
ad the Japanese language. Mebbe those
Sen&mdash;a&mdash;tor kinnod read them. What I shall
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you shall do, baby mine? Did you
think I was goin' to let precious freight like
that go into any post box. Perish the idea,
lovey. You and me are going to waltz downtown
to 27 Broadway, and we ain't going to do
no walking what's more. The Subway for
little us. I'm gambling on Mr. Senator passing
along a job to friends of his friends. Get
your hat on now, and don't answer back
neither.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On the way downstairs she gave a final
stern order to Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hold your hat pin in your hand as we come
out. If his nibs so much as opens his face to
you, jab him in the eye. I'll take care of the
rest of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus bravely armed, the two small warriors
issued forth, the general marshalling her army
of one, with an elevated chin and nose and an
eye that scorched from head to foot the craven
looking object waiting for them on the street.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, dearie. Be careful you don't
get soiled as we pass.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Laughing merrily, the two girls, with music
in their souls, danced up the street, their empty
stomachs and their lost jobs forgotten. When
they reached the Subway, Katy seized Sunny's
hand, and they raced down the steps just as
the South Ferry train pulled in.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVII</p>

<p class="indent">That was a long and exciting ride for
Sunny. Above the roar of the rushing
train Katy shouted in her ear. Perfectly at
home in the Subway, Katy did not let a little
thing like mere noise deter the steady flow of
her tongue. The gist of her remarks came always
back to what Sunny was to do when they
arrived at 27 Broadway; how she was to look;
how speak. She was to bear in mind that she
was going into the presence of American
royalty, and she was to be neither too fresh
nor yet too humble. Americans, high and low,
so Katy averred, liked folks that had a kick
to them, but not too much of a kick.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was to find out whether at some time
or other in the past, Senator Wainwright had
not put himself under deep obligations to some
member of Sunny's family. Perhaps some of
her relatives might have saved the life of this
senator. Even Chinks were occasionally
heroes, Katy had heard. It might be, on the
other hand, said Katy, that Sunny's mother
had something &quot;on&quot; the senator. So much the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
better. Katy had no objection, so she said,
to the use of a bit of refined ladylike blackmail,
for &quot;the end justifies the means,&quot; said
Katy, quoting, so she said, from Lincoln, the
source of all her aphorisms. Anyway, the long
and short of it was, said Katy, that Sunny was
on no account to get cold feet. She was to
enter the presence of the mighty man with
dignity and coolness. &quot;Keep your nerve whatever you do,&quot;
urged Katy. Then once eye to
eye with the man of power, she was to ask&mdash;it
was possible, she might even be able to demand&mdash;certain
favours.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask and it shall be given to you. Shut your
mouth and it'll be taken away. That's how
things go in this old world,&quot; said Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny was to make application in both their
names. If there were no vacancies in the senator's
office, then she would delicately suggest
that the senator could make such a vacancy.
Such things were done within Katy's own experience.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy had no difficulty in locating the monstrous
office building, and she led Sunny along
to the elevator with the experienced air of one
used to ascending skyward in the crowded cars.
Sunny held tight to her arm as they made the
breathless ascent. There was no need to ask
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
direction on the 35th floor, since the Wainwright
Structural Steel Company occupied the
entire floor.</p>

<p class="indent">It was noon hour, and Katy and Sunny
followed several girls returning from lunch
through the main entrance of the offices.</p>

<p class="indent">A girl at a desk in the reception hall stopped
them from penetrating farther into the offices
by calling out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No admission there. Who do you want to
see? Name, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy swung around on her heel, and recognising
a kindred spirit in the girl at the desk,
she favoured her with an equally haughty and
glassy stare. Then in a very superior voice,
Katy replied:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are friends of the Senator. Kindly
announce us, if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A grin slipped over the face of the maiden
at the desk, and she shoved a pad of paper
toward Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">Opposite the word &quot;Name&quot; on the pad,
Katy wrote, &quot;Miss Sindicutt.&quot; Opposite the
word: &quot;Business&quot; she wrote &quot;Private and personal
and intimate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The girl at the desk glanced amusedly at
the pad, tore the first sheet off, pushed a button
which summoned an office boy, to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
she handed the slip of paper. With one eye
turned appraisingly upon the girls, he went off
backwards, whistling, and disappeared through
the little swinging gate that opened apparently
into the great offices beyond.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; said Katy to the girl
at the desk.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't say nothing,&quot; returned the surprised
maiden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought you said 'Be seated.' I will,
thank you. Don't mention it,&quot; and Katy
grinned with malicious politeness on the discomfited
young person, who patted her coiffure
with assumed disdain.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy meanwhile disposed herself on the long
bench, drew Sunny down beside her, and proceeded
to scrutinise and comment on all
passers through the main reception hall into
the offices within. Once in a while she resumed
her injunctions to Sunny, as:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now don't be gettin' cold feet whatever you
do. There ain't nothing to be afraid of. A
cat may look at a king, him being the king and
you the cat. No offence, dearie. Ha, ha, ha!
That's just my way of speaking. Say, Sunny,
would you look at her nibs at the desk there.
Gee! ain't that a job? Some snap, I'll say.
Nothin' to do, but give everyone the once over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
push a button and send a boy to carry in your
names. Say, if you're a true friend of mine,
you'll land me that job. It'd suit me down to
a double Tee.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, I goin' try get you bes' job ad these
place. I am not so smart like you, Katy&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, well, you can't help that, dearie, and
you got the face all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Face is no matter. My mother are tell me
many time, it is those heart that matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Sounds</i> all right, and I ain't questionin'
your mother's opinion, Sunny, but you take it
from me, you can go a darn sight further in
this old world with a face than a heart.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A man had come into the reception room
from the main entrance. He started to cross
the room directly to the little swinging door,
then stopped to speak to a clerk at a wicket
window. Something about the sternness of
his look, an air savouring almost of austerity
aroused the imp in Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, look who's here,&quot; she whispered behind
her hand to Sunny. &quot;Now watch little
K-k-katy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As the man turned from the window, and
proceeded toward the door, Katy shot out her
foot, and the man abstractedly stumbled
against it. He looked down at the girl, impudently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
staring him out of countenance, and
frowned at her exaggerated:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>beg</i> your pardon!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then his glance turning irritably from Katy,
rested upon Sunny's slightly shocked face?
He stopped abruptly, standing perfectly still
for a moment, staring down at the girl. Then
with a muttered apology, Senator Wainwright
turned and went swiftly through the swinging
door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of <i>all</i> the nerve!&quot; said Katy. Then
to the girl at the desk:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who was his nibs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, your friend, of course. I'm surprised
you didn't recognise him,&quot; returned the girl
sweetly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Him&mdash;Senator Wainwright.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The papers sometimes call him 'The Man
of Steel,' but of course, intimate friends like
you and your friend there probably call him
by a nickname.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sure we do,&quot; returned Katy brazenly. &quot;I
call him 'Sen-Sen' for short. I'd a known him
in an instant with his hat off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to know!&quot; gibed the girl at the desk.</p>

<p class="indent">The boy had returned, and thrusting his
head over the short gate sang out:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This way, please, la-adies!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span></p>

<p class="indent">Katy and Sunny followed the boy across an
office where many girls and men were working
at desks. The click of a hundred typewriters,
and the voices dictating into dictagraphs and
to books impressed Katy, but with her head
up she swung along behind the boy. At a door
marked &quot;Miss Hollowell, Private,&quot; the boy
knocked. A voice within bade him &quot;Come,&quot;
and the two girls were admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Hollowell, a clear-eyed young woman
of the clean-cut modern type of the efficient
woman executive, looked up from her work
and favoured them with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; The question was
directed at Katy, but her trained eye went
from Katy to Sunny, and there remained in
speculative inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have come to call upon the Senator,&quot;
said Katy, &quot;on important and private business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy was gripping to that something she
called her &quot;nerve,&quot; but her manner to Miss
Hollowell had lost the gibing patronising
quality she had affected to the girl at the door.
Acute street gamin, as was Katy, she had that
unerring gift of sizing up human nature at a
glance, a gift not unsimilar in fact to that possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
by the secretary of Senator Wainwright.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Hollowell smiled indulgently at Katy's
words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I</i> see. Well now, I'll speak for Mr. Wainwright.
What can we do for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing. <i>You</i> can't do nothing,&quot; said
Katy. She was not to be beguiled by the smile
of this superior young person. &quot;My friend
here&mdash;meet Miss Sindicutt&mdash;has a personal
letter for Senator Wainwright, and she's takin'
my advice not to let it out of her hands into
any but his.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm awfully sorry, because Mr. Wainwright
is very busy, and can't possibly see you.
I believe I will answer the purpose as well.
I'm Mr. Wainwright's secretary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We don't want to speak to no secretary,&quot;
said Katy. &quot;I always say: 'Go to the top.
Slide down if you must. You can't slide up.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Hollowell laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, very well then. Perhaps some other
time, but we're especially busy to-day, so I'm
going to ask you to excuse us. <i>Good</i>-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned back to the papers on her desk,
her pencil poised above a sheet of estimates.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy pushed Sunny forward, and in dumb
show signified that she should speak. Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
Hollowell glanced up and regarded the girl
with singular attention. Something in the expression,
something in the back of the secretary's
mind that concerned Japan, which this
strange girl had now mentioned caused her to
wait quietly for her to finish the sentence.
Sunny held out the letter, and Miss Hollowell
saw that fine script upon the envelope, with the
Japanese letters down the side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This are a letter from Japan,&quot; said Sunny.
&quot;If you please I will lig' to give those to Sen&mdash;Thad
is so big a name for me to say.&quot; The
last was spoken apologetically and brought a
sympathetic smile from Miss Hollowell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can't I read it? I'm sure I can give you
what information you want as well as Mr.
Wainwright can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It are wrote in Japanese,&quot; said Sunny.
&quot;You cannot read that same. <i>Please</i> you let
me take it to thad gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Hollowell, with a smile, arose at that
plea. She crossed the room and tapped on the
door bearing the Senator's name.</p>

<p class="indent">Even in a city where offices of the New York
magnates are sometimes as sumptuously furnished
as drawing rooms, the great room of
Senator Wainwright was distinctive. The
floor was strewn with priceless Persian and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
Chinese rugs, which harmonised with the remarkable
walls, panelled half way up with
mahogany, the upper part of which was hung
with masterpieces of the American painters,
whose work the steel magnate especially
favoured. Stephen Wainwright was seated at
a big mahogany desk table, that was at the far
end of the room, between the great windows,
which gave upon a magnificent view of the
Hudson River and part of the Harbor. He
was not working. His elbows on the desk, he
seemed to be staring out before him in a mood
of strange abstraction. His face, somewhat
stony in expression, with straight grey eyes
that had a curious trick when turned on one of
seeming to pin themselves in an appraising
stare, his iron grey hair and the grey suit which
he invariably wore had given him the name of
&quot;The Man of Steel.&quot; Miss Hollowell, with
her slightly professional smile, laid the slip of
paper on the desk before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Miss Sindicutt. She has a letter for you&mdash;a
letter from Japan she says. She wishes
to deliver it in person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the word &quot;Japan&quot; he came slightly out
of his abstraction, stared at the slip of paper,
and shook his head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't know the name.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I knew you didn't; but, still, I believe
I'd see her if I were you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well. Send her in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Hollowell at the door nodded brightly
to Sunny, but stayed Katy, who triumphantly
was pushing forward.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sorry, but Mr. Wainwright will see just
Miss Sindicutt.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny went in alone. She crossed the room
hesitantly and stood by the desk of the steel
magnate, waiting for him to speak to her. He
remained unmoving, half turned about in his
seat, staring steadily at the girl before him.
If a ghost had arisen suddenly in his path,
Senator Wainwright could not have felt a
greater agitation. After a long pause, he
found his voice, murmuring:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg your pardon. Be seated, please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny took the chair opposite him. Their
glances met and remained for a long moment
locked. Then the man tried to speak lightly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wished to see me. What can I do for
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny extended the letter. When he took
it from her hand, his face came somewhat
nearer to hers, and the closer he saw that young
girl's face, the greater grew his agitation.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is your name?&quot; he demanded
abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny,&quot; said the girl simply, little dreaming
that she was speaking the name that the
man before her had himself invented for her
seventeen and a half years before.</p>

<p class="indent">The word touched some electrical cord within
him. He started violently forward in his
seat, half arising, and the letter in his hand
dropped on the table before him face up. A
moment of gigantic self-control, and then
with fingers that shook, Stephen Wainwright
slipped the envelope open. The words swam
before him, but not till they were indelibly
printed upon the man's conscience-stricken
heart. Through blurred vision he read the
message from the dead to the living.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On this sixth day of the Season of Little
Plenty. A thousand years of joy. It is your
honourable daughter, who knows not your
name, who brings or sends to you this my letter.
I go upon the long journey to the Meido.
I send my child to him through whom she has
her life. Sayonara. Haru-no.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a long, long time the man sat with his
two hands gripped before him on the desk,
steadily looking at the girl before him, devouring
every feature of the well-remembered face
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
of the child he had always loved. It seemed to
him that she had changed not at all. His little
Sunny of those charming days of his youth
had that same crystal look of supreme innocence,
a quality of refinement, a fragrance of
race that seemed to reach back to some old ancestry,
and put its magic print upon the
exquisite young face. He felt he must have
been blind not to have recognised his own child
the instant his eye had fallen upon her. He
knew now what that warm rush of emotion had
meant when he had looked at her in that outer
office. It was the intuitive instinct that his own
child was near&mdash;the only child he had ever had.
By exercising all the self-control that he could
command, he was at last able to speak her
name, huskily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, don't you remember me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Like her father, Sunny was addicted to moments
of abstraction. She had allowed her
gaze to wander through the window to the harbour
below, where she could see the great ships
at their moorings. It made her think of the
one she had come to America on, and the one
on which Jerry had sailed away from Japan.
Painfully, wistfully, she brought her gaze back
to her father's face. At his question she essayed
a little propitiating smile.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mebbe I are see you face on American
ad-ver-tise-ment. I are hear you are very
grade man ad these America,&quot; said the child of
Stephen Wainwright.</p>

<p class="indent">He winced, and yet grew warm with pride
and longing at the girl's delicious accent. He,
too, tried to smile back at her, but something
sharp bit at the man's eyelids.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Sunny. Try and think. Throw your
mind far back&mdash;back to your sixth year, if that
may be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny's eyes, resting now in troubled question
upon the face before her, grew slowly fixed
and enlarged. Through the fogs of memory
slowly, like a vision of the past, she seemed to
see again a little child in a fragrant garden.
She was standing by the rim of a pool, and the
man opposite her now was at her side. He
was dressed in Japanese kimona and hakama,
and Sunny remembered that then he was always
laughing at her, shaking the flower
weighted trees above her, till the petals fell in
a white and pink shower upon her little head
and shoulders. She was stretching out her
hands, catching the falling blossoms, and, delightedly
exclaiming that the flying petals were
tiny birds fluttering through the air. She was
leaning over the edge of the pool, blowing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
petals along the water, playing with her father
that they were white prayer ships, carrying the
petitions to the gods who waited on the other
side. She remembered drowsing against the
arm of the man; of being tossed aloft, her face
cuddled against his neck; of passing under the
great wistaria arbour. Ah, yes! how clearly
she recalled it now! As her father transferred
her to her mother's arms, he bent and drew that
mother into his embrace also.</p>

<p class="indent">Two great tears welled up in the eyes of
Sunny, but ere they could fall, the distance
between her and her father had vanished.
Stephen Wainwright, kneeling on the floor by
his long-lost child, had drawn her hungrily
into his arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My own little girl!&quot; said &quot;The Man of
Steel.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVIII</p>

<p class="indent">Stephen Wainwright, holding
his daughter jealously in his arms, felt
those long-locked founts of emotion that had
been pent up behind his steely exterior bursting
all bounds. He had the immense feeling
that he wanted for evermore to cherish and
guard this precious thing that was all his own.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our actions are followed by their consequences
as surely as a body by its shadow,&quot;
says the Japanese proverb, and that cruel act
of his mad youth had haunted the days of this
man, who had achieved all that some men sell
their souls for in life. And yet the greatest of
all prizes had escaped him&mdash;peace of mind.
Even now, as he held Sunny in his arms, he
was consumed by remorse and anguish.</p>

<p class="indent">In his crowded life of fortune and fame, and
a social career at the side of the brilliant
woman who bore his name, Stephen Wainwright's
best efforts had been unavailing to
obliterate from his memory that tragic face
that like a flower petal on a stream he had so
lightly blown away. O-Haru-no was her name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
then, and she was the child of a Japanese
woman of caste, whose marriage to an attach
of a Russian embassy had, in its time, created
a furore in the capital. Her father had perished
in a shipwreck at sea, and her mother had
returned to her people, there, in her turn, to
perish from grief and the cold neglect of the
Japanese relatives who considered her marriage
a blot upon the family escutcheon.</p>

<p class="indent">Always a lover and collector of beautiful
things, Wainwright had harkened to the enthusiastic
flights of a friend, who had &quot;discovered&quot;
an incomparable piece of Satsuma, and had accompanied
him to an old mansion, once part
of a Satsuma yashiki, there to find that his
friend's &quot;piece of Satsuma&quot; was a living work
of art, a little piece of bric-a-brac that the collector
craved to add to his collections. He had
purchased O-Haru-no for a mere song, for her
white skin had been a constant reproach and
shame in the house of her ancestors. Moreover,
this branch of the ancient family had fallen
upon meagre days, and despite their pride, they
were not above bartering this humble descendant
for the gold of the American. O-Haru-no
escaped with joy from the harsh atmosphere
of the house of her ancestors to the gay home
of her purchaser.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span></p>

<p class="indent">The fact that he had practically bought his
wife, and that she had been willing to become
a thing of barter and sale, had from the first
caused the man to regard her lightly. We
value things often, not by their intrinsic value,
but by the price we have paid for them, and
O-Haru-no had been thrown upon the bargain
counter of life. However, it was not in
Stephen Wainwright's nature to resist anything
as pretty as the wife he had bought. A
favourite and sardonic jest of his at that time
was that she was the choicest piece in his collections,
and that some day he purposed to put
her in a glass case, and present her to the
Museum of Art of his native city. Had indeed
Stephen Wainwright seen the dancer, as she
lay among her brilliant robes, her wide sleeves
outspread like the wings of a butterfly, and
that perfectly chiselled face on which the smile
that had made her famous still seemed faintly
to linger, he might have recalled that utterance
of the past, and realised that no object of art
in the great museum of which his people were
so proud, could compare with this masterpiece
of Death's grim hand.</p>

<p class="indent">He tried to delude himself with the thought
that the temporary wife of his young days was
but an incident, part of an idyll that had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
place in the life of the man of steel, who had
seized upon life with strong, hot hands.</p>

<p class="indent">But Sunny! His own flesh and blood, the
child whose hair had suggested her name.
Despite the galloping years she persisted ever
in his memory. He thought of her constantly,
of her strange little ways, her pretty coaxing
ways, her smile, her charming love of the little
live things, her perception of beauty, her closeness
to nature. There was a quality of psychic
sweetness about her, something rare and delicate
that appealed to the epicure as exquisite
and above all price. It was not his gold that
had purchased Sunny. She was a gift of the
gods and his memory of his child contained no
flaw.</p>

<p class="indent">It was part of his punishment that the
woman he married after his return to America
from Japan should have drifted farther and
farther apart from him with the years. Intuitively,
his wife had recognised that hungry
heart behind the man's cold exterior. She
knew that the greatest urge in the character
of this man was his desire for children. From
year to year she suffered the agony of seeing
the frustration of their hopes. Highstrung
and imaginative, Mrs. Wainwright feared that
her husband would acquire a dislike for her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
The idea persisted like a monomania. She
sought distraction from this ghost that arose
between them in social activities and passionate
work in the cause of woman's suffrage. It was
her husband's misfortune that his nature was
of that unapproachable sort that seldom lets
down the mask, a man who retired within himself,
and sought resources of comfort where indeed
they were not to be found. Grimly,
cynically, he watched the devastating effects of
their separated interests, and in time she, too,
in a measure was cast aside, in thought at least,
just as the first wife had been. Stephen Wainwright
grew grimmer and colder with the
years, and the name applied to him was curiously
suitable.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the man whose tears were falling
on the soft hair of the strange girl from Japan.
He had lifted her hat, that he might again see
that hair, so bright and pretty that had first
suggested her name. With awkward gentleness,
he smoothed it back from the girl's thin
little face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny, you know your father now, fully,
don't you? Tell me that you do&mdash;that you
have not forgotten me. You were within a few
weeks of six when I went away, and we were
the greatest of pals. Surely you have not forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
altogether. It seems just the other day
you were looking at me, just as you are now.
It does not seem to me as if you have changed
at all. You are still my little girl. Tell me&mdash;you
have not forgotten your father altogether,
have you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Those year they are push away. You
are my Chichi (papa). I so happy see you
face again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She held him back, her two hands on his
shoulders, and now, true to her sex, she prepared
to demand a favour from her father.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I think you are going to give Katy
and me mos' bes' job ad you business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Job? Who is Katy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are not told you yet of Katy. Katy are
my frien'.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've told me nothing. I must know
everything that has happened to you since I
left Japan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thas too long ago,&quot; said Sunny sadly, &quot;and
I am hongry. I lig' eat liddle bit something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What! You've had no lunch?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She told him the incident of the dog meat,
not stopping to explain just then who Katy
was, and how she had come to be with her. He
leaned over to the desk and pushed the button.
Miss Holliwell, coming to the door, saw a sight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
that for the first time in her years of service
with Senator Wainwright took away her composure.
Her employer was kneeling by a chair
on which was seated the strange girl. Her
hat was off, and she was holding one of his
hands with both of hers. Even then he did
not break the custom of years and explain or
confide in his secretary, and she saw to her
amazement that the eyes of the man she
secretly termed &quot;the sphinx&quot; were red. All he
said was:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Order a luncheon, Miss Holliwell. Have it
brought up here. Have Mouquin rush it
through. That is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Holliwell slowly closed the door, but
her amazement at what she had seen within
was turned to indignation at what she encountered
without. As the door opened, Katy
pressed up against the keyhole, fell back upon
the floor. During the period when Sunny
had been in the private office of Miss Holliwell's
employer, she had had her hands full
with the curious young person left behind.
Katy had found relief from her pent-up curiosity
in an endless stream of questions and
gratuitous remarks which she poured out upon
the exasperated secretary. Katy's tongue and
spirit were entirely undaunted by the chilling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>[pg&nbsp;276]</span>
monosyllabic replies of Miss Holliwell, and the
latter was finally driven to the extremity of requesting
her to wait in the outer office:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm awfully busy,&quot; said the secretary, &quot;and
really when you chatter like that I cannot concentrate
upon my work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To which, with a wide friendly smile, rejoined
Katy:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheer up, Miss Frozen-Face. Mums the
word from this time on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mum&quot; she actually kept, but her alert pose,
her cocked-up ears and eyes, glued upon the
door had such a quality of upset about them
that Miss Holliwell found it almost as difficult
to concentrate as when her tongue had rattled
along. Now here she was engaged in the degrading
employment of listening and seeing
what was never intended for her ears and eyes.
Miss Holliwell pushed her indignantly away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you <i>mean</i> by doing a thing like
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Between what she had seen inside her employer's
private office, and the actions of this
young gamin, Miss Holliwell was very much
disturbed. She betook herself to the seat with
a complete absence of her cultivated composure.
When Katy said, however:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! I wisht I knew whether Sunny is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
safe in there with that gink,&quot; Miss Holliwell
was forced to raise her hand to hide a smile that
would come despite her best efforts. For once
in her life she gave the wrong number, and was
cross with the girl at the telephone desk because
it was some time before Mouquin's was
reached. The carefully ordered meal dictated
by Miss Holliwell aroused in the listening
Katy such mixed emotions, that, as the secretary
hung up the receiver, the hungry youngster
leaned over and said in a hoarse pleading
whisper:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say, if you're orderin' for Sunny, make it
a double.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Inside, Sunny was telling her father her
story. &quot;Begin from the first,&quot; he had said.
&quot;Omit nothing. I must know everything
about you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Graphically, as they waited for the lunch,
she sketched in all the sordid details of her
early life, the days of their mendicancy making
the man feel immeasurably mean. Sitting
at the desk now, his eyes shaded with his hand,
he gritted his teeth, and struck the table with
repeated soundless blows when his daughter
told him of Hirata. But something, a feeling
more penetrating than pain, stung Stephen
Wainwright when she told him of those warmhearted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
men who had come into her life like a
miracle and taken the place that he should
have been there to fill. For the first time he
interrupted her to take down the names of her
friends, one by one, on a pad of paper. Professor
Barrowes, Zoologist and Professor of
Archeology. Wainwright had heard of him
somewhere recently. Yes, he recalled him
now. Some dispute about a recent &quot;find&quot; of
the Professor's. A question raised as to the
authenticity of the fossil. Opposition to its
being placed in the Museum&mdash;Newspaper discussion.
An effort on the Professor's part to
raise funds for further exploration in Canada
northwest.</p>

while a stab of jealousy struck him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does he do, Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! He are goin' be grade artist-arki-tuck.
He make so beautiful pictures, and he have
mos' beautiful thought on inside his head. He
goin' to make all these city loog beautiful. He
show how make 'partment houses, where all
god light and there's garden grow on top, and
there's house where they not put out liddle
bebby on street. He's go sleep and play on
those garden on top house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her father, his elbow on desk, his chin
cupped on his hand, watched the girl's kindling
face, and suffered pangs that he could not
analyse. Quietly he urged her to continue her
story. Unwilling she turned from Jerry, but
came back always to him. Of her life in Jerry's
apartment, of Hatton and his &quot;yuman 'ankerings&quot;;
of Itchy, with his two fleas; of Mr. and
Mrs. Satsuma in the gold cage, of Count and
Countess Taguchi who swam in the glass bowl;
of the honourable mice; of the butcher and
janitor gentlemen; of Monty, of Bobs, of Jinx,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
who had asked her to marry them, and up to
the day when Mrs. Hammond and Miss Falconer
had come to the apartment and turned
her out. Then a pause to catch her breath in a
wrathful sob, to continue the wistful tale of her
prayer to Kuonnon in the raging, noisy street;
of the mother's gentle spirit that had gone with
her on the dark long road that lead to&mdash;Katy.</p>

<p class="indent">It was then that Miss Holliwell tapped,
and the waiters came in with the great loaded
trays held aloft, bearing the carefully ordered
meal and the paraphernalia that accompanies
a luncheon de luxe. Someone besides the
waiters had slipped by Miss Holliwell. Katy,
clucking with her tongue against the roof of
her mouth, tried to attract the attention of
Sunny, whose back was turned. Sniffing those
delicious odours, Katy came farther into the
room, and following the clucking she let out
an unmistakably false cough and loud Ahem!</p>

<p class="indent">This time, Sunny turned, saw her friend,
and jumped up from her seat and ran to her.
Said Katy in a whisper:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! You're smarter than I gave you
credit for being. Got him going, ain't you?
Well, pull his leg while the going's good, and
say, Sunny, if them things on the tray are for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
you, remember, I gave you half my hot dogs
and I always say&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This are my frien', Katy,&quot; said Sunny
proudly, as the very grave faced man whom
Katy had tried to trip came forward and took
Katy's hand in a tight clasp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katy, this are my&mdash;Chichi&mdash;Mr. Papa,&quot;
said Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">Katy gasped, staring with wide open mouth
from Senator Wainwright to Sunny. Her
head reeled with the most extravagantly romantic
tale that instantly flooded it. Then
with a whoop curiously like that of some small
boy, Katy grasped hold of Sunny about the
waist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whuroo!&quot; cried Katy. &quot;I <i>knew</i> you was a
princess. Gee. It's just like a dime novel&mdash;better
than any story in Hoist's even.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There in the dignified office of the steel magnate
the girl from the east side drew his daughter
into one of the most delicious shimmies, full
of sheer fun and impudent youth. For the
first time in years, Senator Wainwright threw
back his head and burst into laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">Now these two young radiant creatures, who
could dance while they hungered, were seated
before that gorgeous luncheon. Sunny's father
lifted the top from the great planked steak, entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
surrounded on the board with laced
browned potatoes, ornamental bits of peas,
beans, lima and string, asparagus, cauliflower
and mushrooms.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny let forth one long ecstatic sigh as she
clasped her hands together, while Katy laid
both hands piously upon her stomach and raising
her eyes as if about to deliver a solemn
Grace, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Home, sweet home, was never like this!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIX</p>

<p class="indent">Society enjoys a shock. It craves sensation.
When that brilliant and autocratic
leader returned from several months' absence
abroad, with a young daughter, of whose existence
no one had ever heard, her friends were
mystified. When, with the most evident pride
and fondness she referred to the fact that her
daughter had spent most of her life in foreign
lands, and was the daughter of Senator Wainwright's
first wife, speculation was rife. That
the Senator had been previously married, that
he had a daughter of eighteen years, set all
society agog, and expectant to see the girl,
whose debut was to be made at a large coming
out party given by her mother in her honour.
The final touch of mystery and romance was
added by the daughter herself. An enterprising
society reporter, had through the magic
medium of a card from her chief, Mr. Mapson,
of the New York <i>Comet</i>, obtained a special
interview with Miss Wainwright on the eve of
her ball, and the latter had confided to the incredulous
and delighted newspaper woman the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
fact that she expected to be married at an early
date. The announcement, however, lost some
of its thrill when Miss Wainwright omitted the
name of the happy man. Application to her
mother brought forth the fact that that personage
knew no more about this coming event than
the &quot;throb sister,&quot; as she called herself. Mrs.
Wainwright promptly denied the story, pronouncing
it a probable prank of Miss Sunny
and her friend, Miss Clarry. Here Mrs.
Wainwright sighed. She always sighed at the
mention of Katy's name, sighed indulgently,
yet hopelessly. The latter had long since been
turned over to the efficient hands of a Miss
Woodhouse, a lady from Bryn Mawr, who had
accompanied the Wainwright party abroad.
Her especial duty in life was to refine Katy, a
task not devoid of entertainment to said competent
young person from Bryn Mawr, since
it stirred to literary activity certain slumbering
talents, and in due time Katy, through the
pen of Miss Woodhouse, was firmly pinned on
paper.</p>

<p class="indent">However, this is not Katy's story, though it
may not be inapropos to mention here that the
Mrs. J. Lyon Crawford, Jr., who for so long
queened it over, bossed, bullied and shepherded
the society of New York, was under the skin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
ever the same little General who had marched
forth with her army of one down the steps of
that east side tenement house, with hat pin ostentatiously
and dangerously apparent to the
craven rat of the east side.</p>

<p class="indent">Coming back to Sunny. The newspaper
woman persisting that the story had been told
her with utmost candour and seriousness, Mrs.
Wainwright sent for her daughter. Sunny,
questioned by her mother, smilingly confirmed
the story.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. Wainwright,
&quot;You know no young men yet. Surely you
are just playing. It's a game between you and
Katy, isn't it, dear? Katy is putting you up to
it, I'm sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, mama, Katy are&mdash;is&mdash;not do so. <i>I</i> am!
It is true! I am going to make marriage wiz
American gentleman mebbe very soon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling, I believe I'd run along. That will
do for just now, dear. <i>I'll</i> speak to Miss Ah&mdash;what
is the name?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Holman, of the <i>Comet</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, yes, Miss Holman. Run along, dear,&quot;
in a tone an indulgent mother uses to a baby.
Then with her club smile turned affably on
Miss Holman: &quot;Our little Sunny is so mischievous.
Now I'm quite sure she and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
Clarry are playing some naughty little game.
I don't believe I'd publish that if I were you,
Miss Holman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Holman laughed in Mrs. Wainwright's
face, which brought the colour to a
face that for the last few months had radiated
such good humour upon the world. Mrs.
Wainwright smiled, now discomfited, for she
knew that the newspaper woman not only intended
to print Sunny's statement, but her
mother's denial.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Miss Holman, your story will have
no value, in view of the fact that the name of
the man is not mentioned.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought that a defect at first,&quot; said Miss
Holman, shamelessly, &quot;but I'm inclined to
think it will add to the interest. Our readers
dote on mysteries, and I'll cover the story on
those lines. Later I'll do a bit of sleuthing on
the man end. We'll get him,&quot; and the man-like
young woman nodded her head briskly and
betook herself from the Wainwright residence
well satisfied with her day's work.</p>

<p class="indent">An appeal to the editor of the <i>Comet</i> on the
telephone brought back the surprising answer
that they would not print the story if Sunny&mdash;that
editor referred to the child of Senator
Wainwright as &quot;Sunny&quot;&mdash;herself denied it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
He requested that &quot;Sunny&quot; be put on the wire.
Mrs. Wainwright was especially indignant
over this, because she knew that that editor had
arisen to his present position entirely through
a certain private &quot;pull&quot; of Senator Wainwright.
Of course, the editor himself did not
know this, but Senator Wainwright's wife did,
and she thought him exceedingly unappreciative
and exasperating.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wainwright sought Sunny in her room.
Here she found that bewildering young person
with her extraordinary friend enthusing over a
fashion book devoted to trousseaux and bridal
gowns. They looked up with flushed faces,
and Mrs. Wainwright could not resist a feeling
of resentment at the thought that her daughter
(she never thought of Sunny as &quot;stepdaughter&quot;)
should give her confidence to Miss Clarry
in preference to her. However, she masked her
feelings, as only Mrs. Wainwright could, and
with a smile to Katy advised her that Miss
Woodhouse was waiting for her. Katy's
reply, &quot;Yes, ma'am&mdash;I mean, Aunt Emma,&quot;
was submissive and meek enough, but it was
hard for Mrs. Wainwright to overlook that
very pronounced wink with which Katy favoured
Sunny ere she departed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now, dear,&quot; said Mrs. Wainwright,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
putting her arm around Sunny, &quot;tell me all
about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, who loved her dearly, cuddled
against her like a child, but nevertheless shook
her bright head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! That is secret I not tell. I are a
tomb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tomb?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, thas word lig' Katy use when she have
secret. She say it are&mdash;is&mdash;lock up in tomb.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To think,&quot; said Mrs. Wainwright jealously,
&quot;that you prefer to confide in a stranger
like Katy rather than your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I not told Katy yet,&quot; said Sunny
quickly. &quot;She have ask me one tousan' time,
and I are not tol' her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, darling, surely you want <i>me</i> to know.
Is he any young man we are acquainted with?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, finger thoughtfully on her lip, considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o, I think you are not know him yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is he one of the young men who&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was painful for Mrs. Wainwright to contemplate
that chapter in Sunny's past when
she had been the ward of four strange young
men. In fact, she had taken Sunny abroad immediately
after that remarkable time when her
husband had brought the strange young girl to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
the house and for the first time she had learned
of Sunny's existence. Life had taken on a new
meaning to Mrs. Wainwright after that. Suddenly
she comprehended the meaning of having
someone to live for. Her life and work had a
definite purpose and impetus. Her husband's
child had closed the gulf that had yawned so
long between man and wife, and was threatening
to separate them forever. Her love for
Sunny, and her pride in the girl's beauty and
charm was almost pathetic. Had she been the
girl's own mother, she could not have been more
indulgent or anxious for her welfare.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny, not answering the last question, Mrs.
Wainwright went over in her mind each one of
the young men whose ward Sunny had been.
The first three, Jinx, Monty and Bobs, she soon
rejected as possibilities. There remained
Jerry Hammond. Private inquiries concerning
Jerry had long since established the fact
that he had been for a number of years engaged
to a Miss Falconer. Mrs. Wainwright had
been much distressed because Sunny insisted
on writing numerous letters to Jerry while
abroad. It seemed very improper, so she told
the girl, to write letters to another woman's
fianc. Sunny agreed with this most earnestly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
and after a score of letters had gone unanswered
she promised to desist.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wainwright appreciated all that Mr.
Hammond had done for her daughter.
Sunny's father had indeed expressed that appreciation
in that letter (a similar one had been
sent to all members of the Sunny Syndicate)
penned immediately after he had found Sunny.
He had, moreover, done everything in his
power privately to advance the careers and interests
of the various men who had befriended
his daughter. But for his engagement to Miss
Falconer, Mrs. Wainwright would not have
had the slightest objection to Sunny continuing
her friendship with this Mr. Hammond, but
really it was hardly the proper thing under
the circumstances. However, she was both
peeved and relieved when Sunny's many epistles
remained unanswered for months, and then
a single short letter that was hardly calculated
to revive Sunny's childish passion for this
Jerry arrived. Jerry wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Dear Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">Glad get your many notes. Have been away. Glad
you are happy. Hope see you when you return.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">JERRY</span>.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">A telegram would have contained more
words, the ruffled Mrs. Wainwright was assured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
and she acquired a prejudice against
Jerry, despite all the good she had heard of
him. From that time on her rle was to, as
far as lay in her power, distract the dear child
from thought of the man who very evidently
cared nothing about her.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course, Mrs. Wainwright did not know of
that illness of Jerry Hammond when he had
hovered between life and death. She did not
know that all of Sunny's letters had come to
his hand at one time, unwillingly given up by
Professor Barrowes, who feared a relapse from
the resulting excitement. She did not know
that that shaky scrawl was due to the fact that
Jerry was sitting up in bed, and had penned
twenty or more letters to Sunny, in which he
had exhausted all of the sweet words of a
lover's vocabulary, and then had stopped short
to contemplate the fact that he had done absolutely
nothing in the world to prove himself
worthy of Sunny, had torn up the aforementioned
letters, and penned the blank scrawl
that told the daughter of Senator Wainwright
nothing.</p>

<p class="indent">But it was shortly after that that Jerry began
to &quot;come back.&quot; He started upon the
highroad to health, and his recuperation was
so swift that he was able to laugh at the protesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
and anxious Barrowes, who moved
heaven and earth to prevent the young man
from returning to his work. Jerry had been
however, &quot;away&quot; long enough, so he said, and
he fell upon his work with such zeal that no
mere friend or mother could stop him. Never
had that star of Beauty, of which he had always
dreamed, seemed so close to Jerry as now.
Never had the incentive to succeed been so vital
and gloriously necessary. At the end of all his
efforts, he saw no longer the elusive face of the
imaginary &quot;Beauty,&quot; of which he loved to tell
Sunny, and which he despaired ever to reach.
What was a figment of the imagination now
took a definite lovely form. At the end of his
rainbow was the living face of Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">And so with a song within his heart, a light
in his eyes, and a spring to his step, with kind
words for everyone he met, Jerry Hammond
worked and waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wainwright, by this time, knew the
futility of trying to force Sunny to reveal her
secret. Not only was she very Japanese in her
ability to keep a secret when she chose, but she
was Stephen Wainwright's child. Her mother
knew that for months she had neither seen nor
written to Jerry Hammond, for Sunny herself
had told her so, when questioned. Who then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
was the mysterious fianc? Could it possibly
be someone she had known in Japan? This
thought caused Mrs. Wainwright considerable
trepidation. She feared the possibility of a
young Russian, a Japanese, a missionary. To
make sure that Jerry was not the one Sunny
had in mind, she asked the girl whether he had
ever proposed to her, and Sunny replied at
once, very sadly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No-o. I ask him do so, but he do not do so.
He are got 'nother girl he marry then. Jinx
and Monty and Bobs are all ask me marry wiz
them, but Jerry never ask so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear, did you really <i>ask</i> him to ask
you to marry him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I hint for him do so,&quot; said Sunny,
&quot;but he do not do so. Thas very sad for me,&quot;
she admitted dejectedly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very fortunate, I call it,&quot; said Mrs. Wainwright.</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Jerry's elimination was completed, and
for the nonce the matter of Sunny's marriage
was dropped pro tem, to be revived, however,
on the night of her ball, when the story appeared
under leaded type in the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XX</p>

<p class="indent">There have been many marvellous balls
given in the City of New York, but none
exceeding the famous Cherry Blossom ball.
The guests stepped into a vast ball room that
had been transformed into a Japanese garden
in spring. On all sides, against the walls, and
made into arbours and groves, cherry trees in
full blossom were banked, while above and over
the galleries dripped the long purple and white
heads of the wistaria. The entire arch of the
ceiling was covered with cherry branches, and
the floor was of heavy glass, in imitation of a
lake in which the blossoms were reflected.</p>

<p class="indent">Through a lane of slender bamboo the guests
passed to meet, under a cherry blossom bower,
the loveliest bud of the season, Sunny, in a
fairy-like maline and chiffon frock, springing
out about her diaphanously, and of the pale
pink and white colors of the cherry blossoms.
Sunny, with her bright, shining hair coifed by
the hand of an artist; Sunny, with her first
string of perfect pearls and a monstrous
feather fan, that when dropped seemed to cover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
half her short fluffy skirts. Sunny, with the
brightest eyes, darting in and out and looking
over the heads of her besieging guests, laughing,
nodding, breathlessly parrying the questions
that poured in on all sides. Everybody
wanted to know who <i>the</i> man was.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do tell us who he is,&quot; they would urge,
and Sunny would shake her bright head, slowly
unfurl her monstrous fan, and with it thoughtfully
at her lips she would say:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho yes, it are true, and mebbe I will tell
you some nother day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now among those present at Sunny's party
were five men whose acquaintance the readers
of this story have already made. It so happened
that they were very late in arriving at
the Wainwright dance, this being due to the
fact that one of their number had to be brought
there by physical force. Jerry, at dinner, had
read that story in the <i>Comet</i>, and was reduced
to such a condition of distraction that it was
only by the united efforts of his four friends
that he was forcibly shoved into that car. The
party arrived late, as stated, and it may be recorded
that as Sunny's eyes searched that sea
of faces before her, moving to the music of the
orchestra and the tinkle of the Japanese bells,
they lost somewhat of their shining look, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
became so wistful that her father, sensitive to
every change in the girl, never left her side;
but he could not induce the girl to dance. She
remained with her parents in the receiving arbor.
Suddenly two spots of bright rose came
to the cheeks of Sunny, and she arose on tip-toes,
just as she had done as a child on the
tight rope. She saw that arriving party approaching,
and heard Katy's voice as she husbanded
them to what she called &quot;the royal
throne.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this juncture, and when he was within but
a few feet of the &quot;throne&quot; Jerry saw Sunny.
One long look passed between them, and then,
shameless to relate, Jerry ducked into that
throng of dancers. To further escape the
wrathful hands of his friends, he seized some
fat lady hurriedly about the waist and dragged
her upon the glass floor. His rudeness covered
up with as much tact as his friends could muster,
they proceeded, as far as lay in their power,
to compensate for his defection. They felt no
sympathy nor patience with the acts of Jerry.
Were they not all in the same boat, and equally
stung by the story of Sunny's engagement?</p>

<p class="indent">Both hands held out, Sunny welcomed her
friends. First Professor Barrowes:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! How it is good ad my eyes see your
kind face again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Alas! for Sunny's several months with especial
tutors and governesses, and the beautiful
example of Mrs. Wainwright. Always in
moments of excitement she lapsed into her
strangely-twisted English speech and topsy-turvy
grammar.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Barrowes, with the dust in his eyes
and brain of that recent triumphant trip into
the northwest of Canada, brushed aside by the
illness of his friend, was on solid enough earth
as Sunny all but hugged him. Bowing, beaming,
chuckling, he took the fragrant little hand
in his own, and with the pride and glow of a
true discoverer, his eye scanned the fairylike
creature before him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! Miss&mdash;ah&mdash;Sunny. The pleasure is
mine&mdash;entirely mine, I assure you. May I add
that you still, to me, strongly resemble the
child who came upon the tight rope, with a
smile upon her face, and a dewdrop on her
cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May I add,&quot; continued Professor Barrowes,
&quot;that it is my devout hope, my dear, that
you will always remain unchanged? I hope so
devoutly. I wish it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! Mr. dear Professor, I am jos' nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
but little moth. Nothing moach good on these
earth. But you&mdash;you are do so moach I am
hear. You tich all those worl' <i>how</i> those worl'
are be ad the firs' day of all! Tell me 'bout
what happen to you. Daikoku (God of Fortune)
he have been kind to you&mdash;yes?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Astounding kind&mdash;amazingly so. There is
much to tell. If you will allow me, at an early
date, I will do myself the pleasure of calling
upon you, and&mdash;ah&mdash;going into detail. I believe
you will be much interested in recent discoveries
in a hitherto unexplored region of the
Canadian northwest, where I am convinced the
largest number of fossils of the post pliocene
and quaternary period are to be found. I had
the pleasure of assisting in bringing back to
the United States the full-sized skeleton of a
dinornis. You no doubt have heard of the aspersions
regarding its authenticity, but I believe
we have made our&mdash;er&mdash;opponents appear
pretty small, thanks to the aid of your father
and other friends. In point of fact, I may say,
I am indebted to your father for an undeserved
recommendation, and a liberal donation, which
will make possible the fullest research, and establish
beyond question the&mdash;ah&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Holliwell, smiling and most efficiently
and inconspicuously managing the occasion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
noting the congestion about Sunny, and the undisguised
expressions of deepening disgust and
impatience on the faces of Sunny's other
friends, here interposed. She slipped her hand
through the Professor's arm, and with a murmured:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Professor Barrowes, do try this waltz
with me. It's one of the old ones, and this is
Leap Year, so I am going to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now Miss Holliwell had had charge of all
the matters pertaining to the dinornis; her association
with Professor Barrowes had been
both pleasant and gratifying to the man of
science.</p>

<p class="indent">If anyone imagines that sixty-year-old legs
cannot move with the expedition and grace of
youth, he should have witnessed the gyrations
and motions of the legs of Professor Barrowes
as he guided the Senator's secretary through
the mazes of the waltz.</p>

<p class="indent">Came then Monty, upright and rosy, and as
shamelessly young as when over four years before,
at seventeen, he imagined himself wise
and aged-looking with his bone-ribbed glasses.
The down was still on Monty's cheek, and the
adoration of the puppy still in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny! It does my soul good to see you.
You look perfectly great&mdash;yum-yum. Jove,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
you gave us a fright, all right. Haven't got
over it yet. Looked for you in the morgue,
Sunny, and here you are shining like&mdash;like a
star.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty! That face of you will make me
always shine like star. What you are doing
these day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, just a few little things. Nothing to
mention,&quot; returned Monty, with elaborate
carelessness, his heart thumping with pride and
yearning to pour out the full tale into the sympathetic
pink ear of Sunny. &quot;I got a year or
two still to put in&mdash;going up to Johns Hopkins;
then, Sunny, I've a great job for next
summer&mdash;between the postgraduate work. I'll
get great, practical training from a field that&mdash;well&mdash;&mdash;I'm
going to Panama, Sunny.
Connection with fever and sanitary work.
Greatest opportunity of lifetime. I'm to be
first assistant&mdash;it's the literal truth, to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
He whispered a name in Sunny's ear which
caused her to start back, gasping with admiration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Monty; how I am proud of you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it's nothing much. Don't know why in
the world they picked <i>me</i>. My work wasn't
better than the other chaps. I was conscientious
enough and interested of course, but so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
were the other fellows. You could have
knocked me down with a feather when they
picked me for the job. Why, I was fairly
stunned by the news. Haven't got over it yet.
Your father knows Dr. Roper, the chief, you
know. Isn't the world small? Say, Sunny,
whose the duck you're engaged to? G'wan,
tell your old chum.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, Monty, I will tell you&mdash;tonide mebbe
some time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here, here, Monty, you've hogged enough
of Sunny's attention. My turn now.&quot; Bobs
pushed the unwilling Monty along, and the
youngster, pretending a lofty indifference to
the challenging smiles directed at him by certain
members of the younger set, was nevertheless
soon slipping over the floor, with the prettiest
one of them all, whom Mrs. Wainwright
especially led him to.</p>

<p class="indent">Bobs meanwhile was grinning at Sunny,
while she, with a maternal eye, examined &quot;dear
Bobs,&quot; and noted that he had gotten into his
clothes hastily, but that nevertheless he was
the same charming friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By gum, you look positively edible,&quot; was
his greeting. &quot;What you been doing with
yourself, and what's this latest story I'm hearing
about your marrying some Sonofagun?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobs, I are goin' to tell you 'bout those
Sonofagun some time this nide,&quot; smiled Sunny,
&quot;but I want to know firs' of all tings, what you
are do, dear Bobs?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I?&quot; Bobs rose up and down on his polished
toes. &quot;City editor of the <i>Comet</i>, old top, that's
my job. Youngest ever known on the desk,
but not, I hope, the least competent.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, Bobs. You <i>are</i> one whole editor man!
How I am proud of you. Now you are goin'
right up to top notch. Mebbe by'n by you get
to be ambassador ad udder country and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Whew-w! How can a mere man climb to
the heights you expect of him. What I want
to know is&mdash;how about that marriage story?
I printed it, because it was good stuff, but who
is the lucky dog? Come on, now, you know
you can tell me anything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho, Bobs, I <i>are</i> goin' tell you anything.
Loog, Bobs, here are a frien' I wan' you speag
ad. She also have wrote a book. Her name
are&mdash;is Miss Woodenhouse. She is ticher to
my frien', Miss Clarry. She are&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are! Sunny?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;'Am'. She am&mdash;no, is, very good ticher.
She am&mdash;is&mdash;make me and Katy spik and ride
English jos same English lady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The young and edified instructor of Katy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
Clarry surveyed the young and edified editor of
the New York <i>Comet</i> with a quizzical eye.
The young editor in question returned that
quizzical glance, grinned, offered his arm, and
they whirled off to the music of a rippling two-step.</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny had swung around and seized the two
plump soft hands of Jinx, at whose elbow Katy
was pressing. Katy, much to her delight, had
been assisting Miss Holliwell in caring for the
arriving guests, and had indeed quite surprised
and amused that person by her talent for organisation
and real ability. Katy was in her
element as she bustled about, in somewhat the
proprietary manner of the floor walkers and
the lady heads of departments in the stores
where Katy had one time worked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jinx, Jinx, Jinx! My eyes are healty jos'
loog ad you! I am <i>thad</i> glad see you speag
also wiz my bes' frien', Katy.&quot; She clapped
her hands excitedly. &quot;How I thing it nize that
you and Katy be&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katy coughed loudly. Sunny's ignorance at
times was extremely distressing. Katy had a
real sympathy for Mrs. Wainwright at certain
times. Jinx had blushed as red as a peony.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have a heart, Sunny!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless he felt a sleepish pride in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
thought that Sunny's best friend should have
singled him out for special attention. Jinx,
though the desired one of aspiring mothers,
was not so popular with the maidens, who were
pushed forward and adjured to regard him as
a most desirable husband. Katy was partial
to flesh. She had no patience with the artist
who declared that bones were sthetic and to
suit his taste he liked to hear the bones rattle.
Katy averred that there was something awfully
cosy about fat people.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hear some grade news of you, Jinx,&quot; said
Sunny admiringly. &quot;I hear you are got nomin&mdash;ation
be on staff those governor.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's only the beginning, Sunny. I'm
going in for politics a bit. Life too purposeless
heretofore, and the machine wants me. At
least, I've been told so. Your father, Sunny,
has been doggone nice about it&mdash;a real friend.
You know there was a bunch of city hicks that
thought it fun to laugh at the idea of a fat man
holding down any public job, but I guess the
fat fellow can put it over some of the other
bunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ho! I should say that so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Look at President Taft,&quot; put in Katy
warmly. &quot;He weighs more'n you do, I'll bet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Give a fellow a chance,&quot; said Jinx bashfully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
&quot;If I keep on, I'll soon catch up with
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunny,&quot; said Katy in her ear, &quot;I feel
like Itchy. You remember you told me how
after a bath he liked to roll himself in the dirt
because he missed his fleas. That's me all over.
I miss my fleas. I ain&mdash;aren't used to being refined.
Gee! I hope Miss Woodhouse didn't
hear me say that. If she catches me talking like
that&mdash;good-night! D'she ever make <i>you</i> feel
like a two-spot?&quot;&mdash;Scorch with a <i>look</i>! Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A broad grin lighted up Katy's wide Irish
face. Shoving her arm recklessly through
Jinx's, she said:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come along, old skate, let's show 'em on the
floor what reglar dancers like you and me can
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sunny watched them with shining eyes, and
once as they whirled by, Katy's voice floated
above the murmurs of the dance and music:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! How light you are on your feet!
Plump men usually are. I always say&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Katy and Jinx, Monty and Bobs and
the Professor and all her friends were lost to
view in that moving, glittering throng of dancers,
upon whom, like fluttering moths the
cherry blossom petals were dropping from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
above alighting upon their heads and shoulders
and giving them that festival look that Sunny
knew so well in Japan. She had a breathing
space for a spell, and now that very wistful
longing look stole like a shadow back to the
girl's young face. All unconsciously a sigh
escaped her. Instantly her father was at her
side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You want something, my darling?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, papa. You love me very much,
papa?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Do</i> I? If there's anything in the world
you want that I can give you, you have only
to ask, my little girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then papa, you see over dere that young
man stand. You see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Young Hammond?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry.&quot; Her very pronouncement of his
name was a caress. &quot;Papa, I wan speag to
him. All these night I have wan see him.
See, wiz my fan I are do lig' this, and nod my
head, and wiz my finger, too, I call him, but he
do not come,&quot; dejectedly. &quot;Loog! I will do
so again. You see!&quot; She made an unmistakable
motion with her hand and fan at Jerry
and that unhappy young fool turned his back
and slunk behind some artificial camphor
trees.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By George!&quot; said Senator Wainwright.
&quot;Sunny, do you want me to bring that young
puppy to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Papa, Jerry are not a puppy, but jus'
same, I wan' you bring him unto me. Please.
And then, when he come, please you and
mamma stand liddle bit off, and doan let nobody
else speag ad me. I are got something
I wan ask Jerry all by me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The music had stopped, but the clapping
hands of the dancers were clamouring for a
repetition of the crooning dance song that had
just begun its raging career in the metropolis.
Sunny saw her father clap Jerry upon the
shoulder. She saw his effort to escape, and her
father's smiling insistence. A short interval of
breathless suspense, and then the reluctant,
very white, very stern young Jerry was standing
before Sunny. He tried to avoid Sunny's
glance, but, fascinated, found himself looking
straight into the girl's eyes. She was smiling,
but there was something in her dewy glance
that reached out and twisted the boy's heart
strings sadly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry!&quot; said Sunny softly, her great fan
touching her lips, and looking up at him with
such a glance that all his best resolves to continue
calm seemed threatened with panic. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
said, with what he flattered was an imitation of
composure:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lovely day&mdash;er&mdash;night. How are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I are so happy I are lig' those soap bubble.
I goin' burst away.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, naturally you would be happy.
Beautiful day&mdash;er&mdash;night, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He resolved to avoid all personal topics. He
would shoot small talk at her, and she should
not suspect the havoc that was raging within
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are your mother?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are your frien', Miss Falconer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't know, I'm sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatton are tol' me all 'bout her,&quot; said
Sunny.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hatton? He's gone. I don't know
where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He are officer at Salavation Army. He
come to our house, and my father give him
money for those poor people. Hatton are tell
me all 'bout you. I are sawry you sick long
time, Jerry. Thas very sad news for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry, tongue-tied for the moment, knew not
what to say or where to look. Sunny's dear
glance was almost more than he could bear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beautiful room this. Decoration&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, that are your beautiful picture you
are made. I am remember it all. One time
you draw those picture like these for me, and
you say thas mos' nize picture for party ever.
I think so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry, how you are do ad those worl'?
Please tell me. I lig' to hear. Are you make
grade big success? Are you found those
Beauty thad you are loog for always?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Beauty!&quot; he said furiously. &quot;I told you
often enough that it was an elusive jade, that
no one could ever reach. And as for success.
I suppose I've made good enough. I was offered
a partnership&mdash;I can't take it. I'll&mdash;&mdash;I'll
have to get away. Sunny, for God's sake,
answer me. Is it true you are going to be
married?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly the girl bowed with great seriousness,
yet somehow her soft eyes rested in caress upon
the young man's tortured face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jerry,&quot; said Sunny dreamily, &quot;this are the
Year of Leap, and I are lig' ask you liddle bit
question.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jerry neither heard nor understood the significance
of the girlish words. His young face
had blanched. All the joy of life seemed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
have been extinguished. Yet one last passionate
question burst from him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&mdash;is&mdash;he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Slowly Sunny raised that preposterous fan.
She brought it to her face, so that its great expanse
acted as a screen and cut her and Jerry
off from the rest of the world. Her bright
lovely gaze sank right into Jerry's, and Sunny
answered softly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>You!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now what followed would furnish a true student
of psychology with the most irrefutable
proof of the devastating effect upon a young
man of the superior and civilised west of association
with a heathen people. Even the
unsophisticated eye of Sunny saw that primitive
purpose leap up in the eye of Jerry Hammond,
as, held in leash only a moment, he
proposed then and there to seize the girl bodily
in his arms. It was at that moment that her
oriental guile came to the top. Sunny stepped
back, put out her hand, moved it along the
wall, behind the cherry petalled foliage, and
then while Jerry's wild, ecstatic intention
brought him ever nearer to her, Sunny found
and pushed the button on the wall.</p>

<p class="indent">Instantly the room was plunged into darkness.
A babble of murmuring sounds and exclamations;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
laughter, the sudden ceasing of the
music, a soft pandemonium had broken loose,
but in that blissful moment of complete darkness,
oblivious to all the world, feeling and seeing
only each other, Jerry and Sunny kissed.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
