            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>The following are the Guidelines and schema specification for the Winnifred Eaton Archive project (WEA). The project uses a highly constrained version of the TEI Guidelines; the texts are lightly encoded with very little linked data. Primarily, the texts are meant to be easily ported into an existing Omeka framework; the details of this framework are still in development.</p>

         <div>
            <head>Requirements</head>
            <p>To edit material for the site, you will need to use a computer with the following software: <list>
                  <item>Git (to get data from and commit data to the repository). Most computers come with git automatically installed. To check this, open the Command Line (Windows) / Terminal (Mac/Linux) and type in <code rend="block">git --version</code>. If you get something like this in response: <code rend="block">git version 2.17.2 (Apple Git-113)</code>, then you have Git installed. Otherwise, follow the instructions <ref target="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">here</ref>.</item>
                  <item>oXygen XML Editor. (For current RAs, talk to Mary Chapman about licensing.)</item>
                  <item>You must also set up a free Github account <ref target="https://github.com/">here</ref>. It will be connected to your email address; once the Github account is set up, let the repository owner (currently Joey Takeda) know the email address used so that they can grant you write access to the repository.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div>
            <head>Site build process</head>
            <p>The WEA follows the Endings principles for digital humanities sustainability; all of the pages are <q>static</q>, and the site itself has no external or server-side dependencies.</p>
            <p>To build the site, you must have ant installed. In the root directory, run: <code rend="block">ant -lib lib</code>
            </p>
            <p>The site build happens in a number of steps: <list>
                  <item>All of the source files are validated against the RelaxNG schema and the extracted schematron</item>
                  <item>If all files are valid, then the site build (located in <code>/code/buildSite.xml</code>) is initiated. The crucial steps are as follows: <list>
                        <item>Files </item>
                        <item>All of the source XML is flattened into a single directory and massaged slightly to create the <q>original</q> XML</item>
                        <item>The standalone XML is created from the original XML; the standalone XML includes all of the <q>standoff</q> materials, like people, bibliographic items, and taxonomies referenced in the document. The main point of each standalone file is to include every data point necessary for the site to be taken out of the context of the project and used elsewhere.</item>
                        <item>The XHTML5 pages are created from the standalone XML and then validated against the VNU validator</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
                  <item>From the site products, we create a search engine, which runs purely using Javascript within the compiled HTML. Each file is tokenized, and each distinct token is stemmed using the Porter Stemmer algorithm. Each distinct stem is created into individual JSON files, which can then be read by the Javascript on the live site. (Note that the search engine is currently experimental and is largely inspired by Martin Holmes' implementation for The John Keats Project and The Robert Graves Diary Project.)</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <div>
               <head>Current Implementation</head>
               <p>Currently, the site build process is associated with the Continuous Integration service Travis, which triggers the site build with every commit to the the wea_data repository. Travis runs all of the above steps, and then <term>deploys</term> the products to another repository owned by the Winnifred Eaton Archive, currently called <q>wea</q>. This repository is associated with a Github pages scenario, which allows us to view all changes to the site within minutes of every commit.</p>
               <p>Once we are happy with the products on the <q>wea</q> site (also called the <q>beta</q> site), those products can then be deployed on another server (currently we use Github pages in another repository, but this will likely change in the future). To be sure, Travis and Github are <emph>not</emph> necessary for the site build, but purely conveniences for the time being and as an experiment to test the feasibility of creating an Endings compliant site with no need for external servers (and thus, theoretically, for free). Currently, the experiment is proving successful.</p>

         <div xml:id="github">
            <head>Using Github</head>
            <p>All of the data for the project is kept in a Git repository that is hosted through Github. Git is a version control system, which means that one could <q>roll back</q> the site to any particular version, and retrieve any file at any state of editing. Note that Github is a public repository, so all of the data and commit messages you make are visible to anyone. Our Github repository URL is <ref target="https://github.com/winnifredeatonarchive/wea_data">https://github.com/winnifredeatonarchive/wea_data</ref>.</p>
            <p/>
            <div xml:id="github_get">
               <head>Setting up the repository</head>
               <p>To get the data, you must first checkout a copy of the repository as follows:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Open the terminal</item>
                  <item>Create a directory for working in: <code rend="block">mkdir wea</code>
                  </item>
                  <item>Go into the directory: <code rend="block">cd wea</code>
                  </item>
                  <item>Initialize the repository: <code rend="block">git init .</code>
                  </item>
                  <figure>
                     <graphic url="../graphics/git_checkout_1.gif"/>
                  </figure>
                  <item>Pull the repository: <code rend="block">git pull https://github.com/winnifredeatonarchive/wea_data</code>
                  </item>

                     <graphic url="../graphics/git_checkout_2.gif"/>
                  </figure>
               </list>
               <p>Note that you only need to do this the first time you start working in the Github repository.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <head>The Github Workflow</head>
               <p>The normal workflow for working in Github (and any version software) is as follows: <list>
                     <item>Update your repository so that any changes made by others are pushed into your local system</item>
                     <item>Commit the items to the repository</item>
                     <item>Push those items to the Github interface</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <div>
                  <head>Updating</head>
                  <p>Make sure to update as often as possible; always update at the beginning of your working session. </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Go into your working folder: <code rend="block">cd wea</code>
                     </item>
                     <item>Pull the repository: <code rend="block">git pull</code>
                     </item>
                     <figure>
                        <graphic url="../graphics/git_pull_1.gif"/>
                     </figure>
                  </list>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>Committing</head>
                  <p>Unlike some versioning systems, Github requires three steps for committing/saving your work to the repository. <list>
                        <item>First, check the status of your files to see what you have changed since your last commit: <code rend="block">git status</code> If there are no changes to the repository, then you'll like see something like this: <code rend="block"> On branch master nothing to commit, working tree clean</code> If there are changes, you should see something like this: <code rend="block"> On branch master Changes not staged for commit: (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed) (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory) modified: README.md no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code>
                        </item>
                        <figure>
                           <graphic url="../graphics/git_status_1.gif"/>
                        </figure>
                        <item>If there are changes, then add the files/folders that you want to commit to the repository. <code rend="block">git add data/texts/My_Title.xml</code>
                        </item>
                        <figure>
                           <graphic url="../graphics/git_add_1.gif"/>
                        </figure>
                        <item>Third, commit the files to the repository, including a commit message that explains what you did: <code rend="block">git commit -m "Adding new file."</code>
                        </item>
                        <figure>
                           <graphic url="../graphics/git_commit_1.gif"/>
                        </figure>
                        <item>Fourth, push the files to the repository: <code rend="block">git push</code> 
                           <figure>
                              <graphic url="../graphics/git_push_first_1.gif"/>
                           </figure> Note that, if you are committing for the first time, you'll like see something like this: <code rend="block"> Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using git remote add &lt;name&gt; &lt;url&gt; and then push using the remote name git push &lt;name&gt;</code> This means that you must set up your local copy to track the changes in the global repository. To do that, simply follow the above instructions like so: <code rend="block">git remote add wea https://github.com/winnifredeatonarchive/wea_data</code> 
                           <code rend="block">git push wea</code> 
                           <figure>
                              <graphic url="../graphics/git_remote_add_1.gif"/>
                           </figure> You'll then like get another message, saying something like: <code rend="block">fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use git push --set-upstream wea master</code> To resolve that, simply: <code rend="block"> git push --set-upstream wea master</code> 
                           <figure>
                              <graphic url="../graphics/git_push_2.gif"/>
                           </figure> You may then be prompted for your username and password; if this is your first commit, then it might give your instructions on how to store those credentials in your local git system so that you do not need to add your username and password every time you commit.</item>

               <p>All primary source documents should have a related facsimile associated with the document. To do so, simply ensure that the PDF has been added to the <code>data/facsimiles/</code> directory with a filename that follows the rules for filenaming discussed above (no spaces, underscores, et cetera).</p>
               <p>To associate the primary source document with the facsimile, use the <hi rend="att">facs</hi> attribute on the <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element, with a pointer to the facsimile's file name using the private <q>facs:</q> URI scheme: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                  <head>Letters as Quotations and Other Interrupting Texts</head>
                  <p>Often, especially in the novels, letters appear within the regular narrative flow of the text. To handle this, we use the <ref target="#TEI.floatingText">&lt;floatingText&gt;</ref> element: <item>
                        <hi rend="specList-elementSpec">
                           <ref target="#TEI.floatingText">floatingText</ref>
                        </hi>
                        <c xml:space="preserve"> </c>
                        <seg xml:lang="en">contains a single text of any kind, whether unitary or composite, which interrupts the text containing it at any point and after which the surrounding text resumes.</seg>
                     </item> The <ref target="#TEI.floatingText">&lt;floatingText&gt;</ref> element can contain everything a regular <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element can, and so we can use the appropriate encoding to handle the interrupting texts.</p>
                  <p>Most commonly, <ref target="#TEI.floatingText">&lt;floatingText&gt;</ref> will be used in combination with <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref> to handle letters. To encode the letters, we use the specific elements for encoding letters per the TEI: <item>
                        <hi rend="specList-elementSpec">
                           <ref target="#TEI.salute">salute</ref>

                        <c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">salutation</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains a salutation or greeting prefixed to a foreword, dedicatory epistle, or other division of a text, or the salutation in the closing of a letter, preface, etc.</seg>
                     </item> 
                     <item>
                        <hi rend="specList-elementSpec">
                           <ref target="#TEI.signed">signed</ref>
                        </hi>
                        <c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">signature</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">contains the closing salutation, etc., appended to a foreword, dedicatory epistle, or other division of a text.</seg>
                     </item>
                  </p>
                  <p>To encode a letter, first wrap the letter in a <ref target="#TEI.q">&lt;q&gt;</ref>, then a <ref target="#TEI.floatingText">&lt;floatingText&gt;</ref> with an <hi rend="att">type</hi>=<hi rend="val">letter</hi>, and then a <ref target="#TEI.body">&lt;body&gt;</ref> element. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <q>
                           <floatingText type="letter">
                              <body><!--Content of the letter goes here--></body>
                           </floatingText>

                  </p>
                  <p>Most often, letters will contain opening and closing matter; often this is a salute (a salutation) or some signature. These are tagged using the <ref target="#TEI.salute">&lt;salute&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.signed">&lt;signed&gt;</ref> elements, wrapped in <ref target="#TEI.opener">&lt;opener&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.closer">&lt;closer&gt;</ref> tags.

                                    to see you last night, but it was impossible. Lord Eaton’s son,
                                    young Albert, was on the steamer coming over, and they are friends
                                    of the governor’s and I simply had to be with them. You see,
                                    darling, it means a good deal to me in the future, to be in touch
                                    with these people. His brother-in-law, whom I met last night, is
                                    head cockalorum in the House of Parliament, and as I have often
                                    told you, my ambition is to get into politics. It’s the surest road
                                    to fame for a Barrister.</p>
                                 <p>Now I hope my foolish little girl will understand and believe me
                                    when I say that I am thinking for you as much as for myself.</p>

                  <head>Quotations across hierarchies</head>
                  <p>Particularly in novels, quotations will appear across hierarchies; that is, a quotation will start on one page, be interrupted by content on another page, and then continue on the following page. Take, for instance, this example from <title level="m">Marion</title>: <code rend="block"> “It isn’t as if they are strangers, you know. One of them, Harry Bond, is my own fellow. You know who his folks are, and but for them we’d have been married long ago. Well, Harry’s friend, the one who wants to meet you, is a swell, too, and he hasn’t been out from England long. Harry says his folks are big nobs over there, and [Image unavailable.] Someone had passed up to me over the footlights, if you please, a real bouquet of flowers. he is studying law here. His folks send him a remittance and I guess it’s a pretty big one, for he’s living at the Windsor, and I guess he can treat us fine. So come along. You’ll not get such a chance again.”</code> Here, the quotation properly starts at in the first paragraphic block and is then interrupted by an image insert between the pages, and then continues afterwards. To deal with this overlapping hierarchy, there are two steps we must take: <list>
                        <item>First, we must signal that the paragraph before the image inserts is the same paragraph as the one after</item>
                        <item>Second, we must signal that the continue continues across the page hierarchy, but does not include the image (of course, the image is not part of the quoted material).</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To signal the paragraphs continuation, we use the <hi rend="att">part</hi> attribute: <item>
                        <hi rend="specList-elementSpec">
                           <ref target="#TEI.p">p</ref>
                        </hi>
                        <c xml:space="preserve"> </c>(<seg xml:lang="en">paragraph</seg>) <seg xml:lang="en">marks paragraphs in prose.</seg>

                              <cell>
                                 <seg xml:lang="en">specifies whether or not its parent element is fragmented in some way, typically by some other overlapping structure: for example a speech which is divided between two or more verse stanzas, a paragraph which is split across a page division, a verse line which is divided between two speakers.</seg>
                              </cell>
                           </row>
                        </table>
                     </item> We use the value <hi rend="val">I</hi> to signal the initial paragraph, <hi rend="val">M</hi> to signal any medial paragraphs, and <hi rend="val">F</hi> to signal the final paragraph. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

                        been married long ago. Well, Harry’s friend, the one who wants to meet
                        you, is a swell, too, and he hasn’t been out from England long. Harry
                        says his folks are big nobs over there, and</q>
                     </egXML> We do the same thing for the second quotation element, giving it an <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi>: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                        <q xml:id="Marion_q2" prev="#Marion_q1">he is studying law here. His folks send him a remittance and I guess

                                    <p>Good database design involves the acquisition and deployment of
            skills which have a wider relevance to the educational process. From
            a set of more or less instinctive rules of thumb a formal discipline
            or "methodology" of database design has evolved. Applying that
            methodology can be of great benefit to a very wide range of academic
            subjects: it requires fundamental skills of abstraction and
            generalisation and it provides a simple mechanism whereby complex
            ideas and information structures can be represented and manipulated,
            even without the use of a computer. </p>

                                       <p>Data from 9,701 participants in the National Health and Nutrition
            Examination Survey, 2001-2010, aged 2 to 11 years were analyzed.
            Child-level food insecurity was assessed with the US Department of
            Agriculture's Food Security Survey Module based on eight
            child-specific questions. Personal food insecurity was assessed with
            five additional questions. Obesity was defined, using physical
            measurements, as body mass index (calculated as kg/m2) greater than
            or equal to the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile of the Centers
            for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts. Logistic
            regressions adjusted for sex, race/ethnic group, poverty level, and
            survey year were conducted to describe associations between obesity
            and food insecurity.</p>

                                       <head> RESULTS:</head>
                                       <p>Obesity was significantly associated with personal food insecurity
            for children aged 6 to 11 years (odds ratio=1.81; 95% CI 1.33 to
            2.48), but not in children aged 2 to 5 years (odds ratio=0.88; 95%
            CI 0.51 to 1.51). Child-level food insecurity was not associated
            with obesity among 2- to 5-year-olds or 6- to 11-year-olds.</p>

                                       <head> CONCLUSIONS:</head>
                                       <p>Personal food insecurity is associated with an increased risk of
            obesity only in children aged 6 to 11 years. Personal
            food-insecurity measures may give different results than aggregate
            food-insecurity measures in children.</p>

                then be redeemed with 120 shillings; and the kindred are to stand surety for him
                that he will desist for ever.</item>

            his guilty man, so that the king is appealed to, is to repay the value of the goods and
            120 shillings to the king; and he who appeals to the king before he demands justice as
            often as he ought, is to pay the same fine as the other would have done, if he had

the American Civil War. It occurred September 19, 1861, in Knox
County, Kentucky during the campaign known as the Kentucky Confederate
Offensive. The battle is considered the first Confederate victory in
the commonwealth, and threw a scare into Federal commanders, who
rushed troops to central Kentucky in an effort to repel the invasion,
which was finally thwarted at the <ref target="#event02">Battle of

The Battle of Camp Wildcat (also known as Wildcat Mountain and Camp
Wild Cat) was one of the early engagements of the American Civil
War. It occurred October 21, 1861, in northern Laurel County, Kentucky
during the campaign known as the Kentucky Confederate Offensive. The
battle is considered one of the very first Union victories, and marked
the first engagement of troops in the commonwealth of Kentucky.</desc>

in Harrison County, Kentucky, near the town of Cynthiana. A part of
Confederate Brigadier General John Hunt Morgan's 1864 Raid into
Kentucky, the battle resulted in a victory by Union forces over the
raiders and saved the town from capture.</desc>

An explicit indication of the phrase or line annotated may however be used instead (e.g. <q>page 218, lines 3–4</q>). The <hi rend="att">anchored</hi> attribute indicates whether any explicit location is given, whether by symbol or by prose cross-reference. The value <hi rend="val">true</hi> indicates that such an explicit location is indicated in the copy text; the value <hi rend="val">false</hi> indicates that the copy text does not indicate a specific place of attachment for the note. If the specific symbols used in the copy text at the location the note is anchored are to be recorded, use the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute.</p>

                           <p xmlns:teix="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">When this element appears within an <gi>index</gi> element, it is understood to supply the form under which an index entry is to be made for that location. Elsewhere, it is understood simply to indicate that its content is to be regarded as a technical or specialised term. It may be associated with a <gi>gloss</gi> element by means of its <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute; alternatively a <gi>gloss</gi> element may point to a <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> element by means of its <hi rend="att">target</hi> attribute.</p>
                           <p xmlns:teix="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">In formal terminological work, there is frequently discussion over whether terms must be atomic or may include multi-word lexical items, symbolic designations, or phraseological units. The <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> element may be used to mark any of these. No position is taken on the philosophical issue of what a term can be; the looser definition simply allows the <ref target="#TEI.term">&lt;term&gt;</ref> element to be used by practitioners of any persuasion.</p>
                           <p xmlns:teix="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">As with other members of the <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident> class, instances of this element occuring in a text may be associated with a canonical definition, either by means of a URI (using the <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute), or by means of some system-specific code value (using the <hi rend="att">key</hi> attribute). Because the mutually exclusive <hi rend="att">target</hi> and <hi rend="att">cRef</hi> attributes overlap with the function of the <hi rend="att">ref</hi> attribute, they are deprecated and may be removed at a subsequent release.</p>

By default, the attributes from the <ident type="class">att.datable.w3c</ident> class are provided. If the module for names &amp; dates is loaded, this class also provides attributes from the <ident type="class">att.datable.iso</ident> and <ident type="class">att.datable.custom</ident> classes. In general, the possible values of attributes restricted to the W3C datatypes form a subset of those values available via the ISO 8601 standard. However, the greater expressiveness of the ISO datatypes may not be needed, and there exists much greater software support for the W3C datatypes.</p>

The tag is made of the following subtags, in the following order. Every subtag except the first is optional. If present, each occurs only once, except the fourth and fifth components (variant and extension), which are repeatable. <list type="gloss">

                                 <item>The IANA-registered code for the language. This is almost always the same as the ISO 639 2-letter language code if there is one. The list of available registered language subtags can be found at <ptr target="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry"/>. It is recommended that this code be written in lower case.</item>

These codes consist of 4 letters, and it is recommended they be written with an initial capital, the other three letters in lower case. The canonical list of codes is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, and is available at <ptr target="http://unicode.org/iso15924/iso15924-codes.html"/>. The IETF recommends this code be omitted unless it is necessary to make a distinction you need.</item>

                                 <item>Either an ISO 3166 country code or a UN M.49 region code that is registered with IANA (not all such codes are registered, e.g. UN codes for economic groupings or codes for countries for which there is already an ISO 3166 2-letter code are not registered). The former consist of 2 letters, and it is recommended they be written in upper case; the list of codes can be searched or browsed at <ptr target="https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/"/>. The latter consist of 3 digits; the list of codes can be found at <ptr target="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm"/>.</item>

                                 <item>An IANA-registered variation. These codes <quote rend="quoted">are used to indicate additional, well-recognized variations that define a language or its dialects that are not covered by other available subtags</quote>.</item>
                                 <label>extension</label>
                                 <item>An extension has the format of a single letter followed by a hyphen followed by additional subtags. These exist to allow for future extension to BCP 47, but as of this writing no such extensions are in use.</item>
                                 <label>private use</label>
                                 <item>An extension that uses the initial subtag of the single letter <mentioned>x</mentioned> (i.e., starts with <code>x-</code>) has no meaning except as negotiated among the parties involved. These should be used with great care, since they interfere with the interoperability that use of RFC 4646 is intended to promote. In order for a document that makes use of these subtags to be TEI-conformant, a corresponding <ref target="#TEI.language">&lt;language&gt;</ref> element must be present in the TEI header.</item>
