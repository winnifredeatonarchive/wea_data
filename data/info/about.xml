                <head>About</head>
                <p>The Winnifred Eaton Archive is an accessible, fully searchable, digital scholarly edition of the collected works of Winnifred Eaton Babcock Reeve, best known for the popular Japanese romances she signed <q>Onoto Watanna</q>. It comprises page images and transcriptions of nearly 200 located publications and manuscripts, as well as supplemental materials that will aid students and scholars of Eaton’s work. Ultimately, it aims to collect all known publications, manuscripts, and films by Eaton in one location.</p>
                
                <p>The original Winnifred Eaton Digital Archive was created by Jean Lee Cole (Loyola University Maryland) in 2004 in conjunction with the University of Virginia E-text Center. It contained edited transcriptions of two serialized novels and dozens of periodical publications held in the Winnifred Eaton Reeve Fonds at the University of Calgary and/or discovered by Cole over the previous decade through manual searching. These texts were encoded using the Textual Encoding Initiative P4 schema. These texts are still available in the UVa Text Collection accessible through the University of Virginia Libraries’ VIRGO catalog https://search.lib.virginia.edu/</p>
                
                <p>In the Winnifred Eaton Archive’s second phase, Mary Chapman (University of British Columbia), together with her research team in collaboration with Cole, updated Cole’s original archive to conform with the Textual Encoding Initiative P5 schema and added edited encoded transcriptions of dozens of additional periodical publications she discovered, as well as additional manuscripts held in the Winnifred Eaton Reeve Fonds. Chapman also added to the site biographical information, a bibliography, a timeline, a list of pseudonyms, a copy of a film for which Eaton wrote the screenplay, and numerous photographs relevant to Eaton and her family. </p> 
                
                <p>The Winnifred Eaton Archive is organized into exhibits that roughly correspond to periods in Eaton’s career. These periods overlap chronologically somewhat: <q>Early Experiments</q> features texts written in the 1890s and early 1900s during Eaton’s writing apprenticeship in Montreal and Jamaica, and/or before she had taken up her identity as <q>Onoto Watanna</q>; <q>Playing Japanese</q> collects all texts written on Japanese subjects and themes from 1897 until 1922; <q>New York Years</q> collects texts marking a period of reinvention, from 1902-1916 after the novelty of Eaton’s Japanese romances had faded; <q>Alberta</q> collects texts written about Western ranch country, during her years living in Alberta, roughly 1919-1933; and finally, <q>In Hollywood</q> collects her screenplays, treatments, extant films, as well as fiction about the movie business written from 1921-1935.</p></div>
