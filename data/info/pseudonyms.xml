            <p>Winnifred Eaton may be better known today as Onoto Watanna, the <q>Japanese-sounding</q> pseudonym under which she wrote most popularly and most prolifically. But she experimented with several other authorial identities over the course of her career. Some, like Ellis Eaton, obscured her gender; others, like <q>Winnifred Eaton Reeve</q>, appeared to reflect the names under which she went about in Calgary society. Ironically, she published her most personal writings, Me and Marion, under no name at all. The variety and variations of Winnifred Eatonâ€™s many names point to a writer who may have seen identity--or at least names--as fluid and ever-shifting.
