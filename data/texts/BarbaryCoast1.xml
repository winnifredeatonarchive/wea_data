            <p><stage type="location">Lodging house.</stage> The Reverend Roger Storm, graduate of Harvard Divinity School. He appears a bit priggish, but in reality is a well meaning, nice young chap, though dead serious so far as his religion is concerned.</p>
            <p>In the same lodging house lives Susy Rooney. Susy is a product of the Barbary Coast, inasmuch as she was actually born there, her father being the owner of one of the gilded palaces--a combination saloon and dance-hall. We bring out that all Susy’s memories of Barbary Coast are pleasant ones. The painted ladies and fashionable gentleman whom she saw in her father’s establishment as a child were her first idols. She is awfully sore because her father insists on her living away from his own place of business, where he has apartment. Big Bill Rooney, her father, thinks that she is safely tucked away in a convent--as we bring out in a line or two of dialogue--when in reality she has escaped from the Dominican Convent across the bay in <placeName>San Rafael</placeName> and is blowing the liberal allowance her father has always prodigally settled on her. She is having a whale of a good time and has gathered about her a number of kindred spirits. Susy, who declares she was raised on whiskey while other kids had milk, always has plenty of booze in her rooms, and she and her friends keep up an eternal <pb n="2"/><fw type="pageNum">2</fw>and infernal racket. (According to the young Reverend Roger Storm). She is her father’s own child--sometimes these parties of hers run on till as late as the appalling hour of eleven o’clock! </p>
            <p>Much to his irritation, and to Susy’s amusement, the young minister and the girl are always meeting on the stairs or in other parts of the lodging-house. Susy never fails to make some audible comment, not especially flattering to Roger’s cloth and dignity. He in turn considers her unregenerate and hopeless. Susy looks upon <emph rendition="rnd:underlined">him</emph> as a joke. He catches her making fun of him and ‘taking him off’ behind his back to her friends, in the lodging-house parlor. He is furious with himself, because he cannot get her off his mind, and finally decides that it is his bounded duty to save her.</p>
            <p>Susy throws one of her parties, that night, in her rooms, and at the height of the festivities Roger hammer upon the door and threatens the merry-makers with the police. Their ungodly noises are not to be endured, he feels. They all razz him. Susy, who is simply having a good time who appears to the minister to be drunk, <subst>
               <del>uges</del>
               <add>urges</add>
            </subst>her friends to muss his pretty clothes. He refuses to fight, because of his dignity, and goes out with her taunts of <q>Coward! White-liver!</q> ringing in his burning ears. They throw shoes and <subst>
               <del>botless</del>
               <add>bottles</add>
            </subst> at him--one of Susy’s slippers following him out into the hall. He picks up the <subst>
               <del>shoes</del>
               <add>slipper</add>
            </subst>, looks at it thoughtfully, and carries it with him down to his room. One of the girl’s friends suggests that they all go to his <q>prayer-dive</q>--his Midnight Mission, which he conducts in a dilapidated store-room for the benefit of drunkards and bums, and raise a rumpus there.</p>
            <p>The minister decides that he will move away. He is very much respected by his landlady, and when he gives her notice as he goes out on his way to the Mission, she declares that she’ll clean out all the undesirable element in the house rather than have him leave.</p>

            <p>This is a Midnight Mission, down in a squalid part of the city--<q>South of The Slot</q>, as it is called in <placeName>San Francisco</placeName>. <view>We show the minister not preaching, but feeding, a long <subst>

               <add>friends</add>
            </subst> and a couple of women. They are all a little lit, and ready for anything in the way of fun. One of the men starts for the little barrel-organ in the corner, and they all begin to sing <q>Ta Ra Ra Boom-de-ay</q> and other wild songs of the period, and prance and dance about the place. <note>We will go into the detail of the general effect here.</note> The minister herds his men into an adjoining room, comes back, and in a quiet level voice--very loud and clear--says, <q>I shall give you exactly two minutes to leave this place!</q> They all roar with laughter, and the men lurch towards him belligerently. Rogers watches the clock, and when exactly two minutes have passed <choice>
               <sic>her</sic>
               <corr>he</corr>
            </choice> hurls one of the men through the door. A fight follows, three against one, in which he puts out the whole crew of them. Susy, astonished at seeing it turn out this way and secretly impressed by the prowess of the minister, lingers a moment, when he takes her by the shoulder and says, <q>Now you clear out too!</q>  and pushes her out. This enrages her. She thrusts the door open and shouts defiance at him: <q>You’re not only a prig, you’re a bully!</q></p>

            <head>SEQUENCE THREE</head>
            <p><stage type="location">The lodging-house again.</stage> Susy, returning, finds her baggage out on the sidewalk. She rings the bell angrily and arouses the landlady, who tells her that she won’t have trash like her driving away respectable people such as the fine young minister. Susy is in a fine rage. She screams insults, and throws a brick through the window--the minister’s window. He has not returned yet. She is firmly <subst>

               <add>convinced</add>
            </subst> that it is the minister who has had her ejected.</p>
            <pb n="4"/><fw type="pageNum">4</fw>
            <p>The minister returns late at night from his Mission. We see him sitting in his room disconsolately. He picks up the little feminine slipper and fondles it. He is thinking--he talks aloud to himself--of what the girl called him. <q>Prig. Bully!</q> <emph rend="underlined">Is</emph> he no more than a well-meaning but stupid prig? he asks himself. This train of thought is running through his mind when the landlady knocks at his door and announces to him self-satisfiedly, <q>That low hussy’ll never bother you again, sir. I threw her out in the stree.</q>--He is astounded, and is angry with the woman for having thrown a girl out into the streets to almost certain ruin there. <q>Ah, she came from the streets, and she can go back to ‘em, the Barbary Coast scum!</q> the landlady says. The young minister is appalled by the realization that if the girl does go to the bad, the responsibility lies solely on his own shoulders. Worse, he is now face to face with the undeniable fact that he is in love with Susy--the wild beautiful creature.</p>
