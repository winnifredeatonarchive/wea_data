            <p>In a recent number of the Top-Notch Magazine there appeared a <q>Canadian</q> story
               by an American author. The story is entitled <q>The Terror of the North</q>. The
               following description will amaze and amuse Canadians and give some idea of how Canada
               is described in American fiction.</p>
            <p><q>The man who carreid the mail from Regina to Saskatoon cracked his whip over the
                  shaggy backs of his six huskies and peered into the encompassing blackness. It was
                  somewhere near midday, but almost as dark as midnight, for masses of blue-black
                  clouds hid the sun, and a storm was raging in the heights of the north</q>.</p>
            <p>Not to be outdone in description of Canada, another American author, one who writes
               with skill, pictures a baseball match at Guelph, Ontario, watched by a stolid
               audience of Indians and squaws<note type="editorial" resp="pers:LW1">This is an
                  offensive racial slur. Please see our <ref target="doc:note_on_language">note on
                     language</ref>.</note> in blankets and feather headdresses. </p>
            <p>Victor Lauriston, the Canadian author of <q>The Twenty-first Burr</q>, draws
               attention to the fact that Indians of that sort in Guelph would draw a bigger crowd
               than a baseball match, for <q>the baseball germ in the Royal City is so old a
                  resident that the place is pretty well immunized. The Guelph ‘Maple Leafs’ toured
                  the States in the days when the great American pastime was still young</q>.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lauriston, in a recent letter, tells of a personal experience with an American
               editor in New York to whom he was trying to sell some stories whose locale was
               Chatham, Ontario. </p>
            <p><q>A neighbor of yours writes for us quite a bit</q>, said the editor.</p>
            <p><q>A neighbor! Who is he?</q></p>
            <p><q>Douglas Durkin. You’re from Chatham, aren’t you? Well, he lives right near
               you</q></p>
            <p><q>Durkin lives in the west — near Winnipeg</q>.</p>
            <p><q>That’s not far from Chatham, is it?</q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, no. Only about a thousand miles</q>.</p>
            <p>On February 8 Calgary will have an opportunity of seeing Canada’s poet laureate in
               recital at the Central Methodist church. This may be the last time that an
               opportunity will be afforded Calgarians of seeing Canada’s best loved poet, Bliss
               Carman, for his health has been poor of late years, and the traveling exacts a heavy
               toll from a man of Mr. Carman’s age. </p>
            <p><q>Oh, did you once see Shelley!</q> Those words still throb with the eager hero
               worship of the poet that wrote them. The time may come when others will ask us
               whether we had actually seen Canada’s Carman. </p>
            <p>It is said that the Normal school, from which a large attendance had been expected,
               have invited the Normal school of Carbon to come to Calgary for a dance on the night
               of the poet’s recital. An effort is to be made to induce the Normal school to change
               their invitation to read <q>recital</q> instead of dance, or to bring their friends
               to hear the Canadian poet prior to the dance.</p>
            <p>Mrs. McClung, in her address before the local council of women at their recent
               banquet, pointed out that the coming of the Canadian poet to Calgary was an event
               that should be noted by all who are lovers of poetry and are patriotic. </p>
            <p>Wilson McDonald, the Canadian poet, was a recent visitor for a couple of days in
               Calgary. WHile here he attended the Gladys Attree special performance of exhibition
               dancing, and expressed a deep interest in the Little Theater movement in Calgary. Mr
               McDonald is the author of an opera entitled <q>In Sunny France</q>. It was put on in
               Toronto by Hart House, the <q>Little Theater</q> of that city, and ran continuously
               for a couple of weeks, playing to capacity audiences. It has also been put on by
               other Little Theaters, and is now being rehearsed in Moose Jaw, under the auspices of
               the local council of women.</p>
            <p>Mr. McDonald, as soon as he learned of the Little Theater movement in Calgary,
               immediately offered his opera for an initial vehicle for the association. Besides
               giving his opera to the newly formed association, Mr. McDonald is willing to come to
               Calgary and personally rehearse the piece, as he has done in other cities. Besides
               writing the libretto and lyrics, he is also the author of the music, and composed the
               dances, and he plays one of the parts himself.</p>
            <p>This generous offer may well appeal to the association which is to be formed some day
               this week at an open meeting to which the public is urged to come. </p>
