            <p>The first instalment of the prize novel, <q>The Bond Triumphant</q>, by <name
                  ref="pers:GG2">Gordon Hill Grahame</name>, in the July 1 issue of the MacLean’s
               Magazine, has created such excitement and indignation in Catholic circles, that the
               publishers of this magazine announce the discontinuance of the serial. In a strong
               editorial in the Catholic Register and Canadian Extension, the novel is denounced as:
                  <q>A misrepresentation of things Catholic, a distortion of facts, a caricature of
                  the Catholic priesthood, a gross libel on <name ref="pers:FL1">Laval</name>, a
                  tissue of historical inaccuracies</q>, and so forth. This excoriating editorial is
               followed by another in the same paper by L. Minehan in defense of the <q>great
                  prelate, great patriot, great humanitarian</q>, <name ref="pers:FL1">Bishop
                  Laval</name>, whom, it would appear, <name ref="pers:GG2">Mr. Grahame</name>’s
               novel has pictured in unflattering terms. MacLean’s Magazine now announce that <q>The
                  Bond Triumphant</q> is to be substituted by <name ref="pers:NW1">Mrs. Wilson
                  Woodrow</name>’s novel, <q>Thoroughbred</q>.</p>
            <p>The second prize in this novel contest was taken by a resident of Calgary, <name
                  ref="pers:FW1">Mrs. Flos Jewel Williams</name>, and it would seem as if her novel,
                  <q>The <choice>
                     <sic>Judgment</sic>
                     <corr>Judgement</corr>
                  </choice> of Solomon</q>, was the proper vehicle to take the place of the
               discarded serial. Particularly so, in view of the fact that MacLean’s have always
               harped upon the fact that they are an <q>all-Canadian</q> magazine, and, as such,
               solicit subscriptions throughout Canada. I am an admirer of the American author,
                  <name ref="pers:NW1">Mrs. Wilson Woodrow</name>, but in a Canadian prize novel
               contest one naturally looks for a novel by a Canadian.</p>
