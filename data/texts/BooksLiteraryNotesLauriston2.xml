            <p><q>The Twenty-first Burr</q>, by <name ref="pers:VL1">Victor Lauriston</name>, is one
               of the best mystery stories published during the past season. Anyone who enjoys a
               yarn full of suspense and tension should read this story. The author is an
               interesting young man who not so long ago was in Calgary investigating the oil
               situation. He is a chum and fellow townsman of <name ref="pers:AS2">Arthur
                  Stringer</name>, and may, at this time of writing, have joined his friend in New
               York. Like <name ref="pers:AS2">Stringer</name>, <name ref="pers:VL1">Mr.
                  Lauriston</name>’s heart is in Canada, but with the new restrictions of the
               copyright law and the discouraging outlook for the author in Canada, <name
                  ref="pers:VL1">Lauriston</name> is unwillingly expatriating himself in order to
               make a living at his writing. For some time <name ref="pers:VL1">Mr. Lauriston</name>
               has been connected with the Chatham Daily News, doing a literary column that has been
               widely copied in other newspapers over the country because of its scintilating
               observations on things literary and because besides being an author of books <name
                  ref="pers:VL1">Mr. Lauriston</name> is also one of the best known of the younger
               critics in Canada.</p>

            <p>We were recently amused by the naive statement of the president of the women’s club
               who referred to a certain new novel as being a success because it had had a sale of
               2000 copies. A sale of 2000 copies would net an author about $100. Perhaps less than
               that, and perhaps a bit more, according to the percentage. But in any event it would
               barely pay for the cost of printing. A sale of 10,000 means only mediocre
               recognition. A sale of 50,000 does not make an author rich. When one touches the
               100,000 sale class then one may speak of success. That is, so far as the sale part is
               concerned. Many books, however, earn something almost as precious as mere sales for
               the author, namely, prestige. If a first book wins that for the author, he has done
               well, since if he can follow up with something better than his first book, his
               chances are excellent.</p>

            <p>Some authors are what is known as <q>one book</q> authors. That is to say, they
               produce one book into which they pour all that they have to give. They cannot follow
               up because they have given their best. Their critics demand that they maintain the
               standard they have set, and when their following productions do not measure up to the
               first they soon disappear into obscurity. They are a flash in the pan. That is why
               swift success for an author is bad for him. His head is turned by injudicious praise
               before he has found solid ground. I know of any number of such cases, and the results
               have been painful. Time and hard work have a chastening and indeed inspiring effect
               upon the writer that in the end is invaluable to him.</p>

            <p><name ref="pers:CM1">Charles Major</name>, author of <q>When Knighthood Was in
                  Flower</q>, once told me he wished that he had written his novel, <q>Dorothy
                  Vernon of Haddon Hall</q>, before he had his <q>Knighthood</q>, for the latter
               book had a tremendous vogue and immense sale. The result was that the publishers paid
               him for <q>Dorothy Vernon</q> $60,000 for the rights, and the book barely sold at
               all. Mr. Brett, publisher, of MacMillan and Co., told me of the disappointment in the
               sale of the second book, which, however, at this late day, is now likely to come into
               its own, at least through the medium of the films.</p>

            <p>Some disappointed authors disparage the films as a literary medium. Privately they
               seek the film companies and try to induce them to accept their work, but when it is
               turned down they are loud in belittling the value of motion pictures. <name
                  ref="pers:MMF1">Minnie Maddern Fiske</name>, America’s greatest actress, with the
               possible exception of <name ref="pers:MA1">Maude Adams</name>, once said to me that
               she considered motion pictures an even higher form of art than the stage. She based
               her opinion upon the fact that it would survive when the dramatic productions were
               passed. She said: <q>Suppose we could see Rachel, Booth and other great actors in the
                  film today! One hundred years from now fancy seeing Bernhardt or Duse! Suppose we
                  could see today in the films the shadow productions of ancient Greece</q>.</p>

            <p><name ref="pers:MMF1">Mrs. Fiske</name> said that she thought that no picture painted
               by the hand of man could excel some of the magnificent masterpieces of the
               silver-sheet. No story of the written page has the sheer poetic merit of certain
               lovely things upon the screen.</p>

            <p>It is a pity that the greater number of film plays—sensational and preposterous—have,
               in a way, debauched the entire art of the motion pictures; for, of course, it is an
               art—an immense and vital one. There have, however, been certain productions that
               justify its enthusiasts in the claim that it is a medium that cannot be surpassed for
               artistic expression.</p>

            <p>The plays by <name ref="pers:DWG1">D. W. Griffith</name> have more literary merit
               than the average written story; <name ref="pers:EC1">Elmer Clifton</name>’s <q>Down
                  to the Sea in Ships</q> is a classic of the sea. Some of the French and German
               productions are terrific realism.</p>

            <p>I am not a movie fan, but I am of those who smile when I hear people disparaging the
               films, and claim it is a low form of expression. It can, in fact, be anything—low or
               high, and therein lies its real greatness—its immense range.</p>

            <p>It is often said by those who do not know, that it is as easy as fishing to write for
               the movies. Anyone can do it. Those who do, however, are wont to declare, with a
               sigh, that it is about as easy to <q>break into the films</q> as for the rich man to
               slip through the proverbial needle’s eye. However, the common notion that writing for
               films is an easy renumerative employment prevails, and is fostered also by many
               agents and concerns that thrive and have their being by teaching the <q>young</q>
               ideas how to shoot through the films. Renumerative it is, in fact, to him who
                  <q>makes the grade</q>, but not many get beyond the outer portals. <name
                  ref="pers:AS2">Arthur Stringer</name> speaks lightly of $5000 for a short story in
               the films and $30,000 or $40,000 for a large film play. <name ref="pers:AS2">Arthur
                  Stringer</name> is not exceptional. The rewards for the successful writer of film
               plays are indeed immense. On the other hand there are a great many would-be writers
               expending strength and energy and heart-rending mental effort in attempting to
               accomplish the impossible feat of wedging a way in. Not only is this true of the
               writers, but of numerous folk who have been deluded by the utterly preposterous
               suggestion that anyone can write for the screen. </p>
