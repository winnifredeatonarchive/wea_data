               Canadian Authorship</byline></opener>
         <div>
            <p>Canada, particularly the west, has suffered and is suffering greatly from gross
               misrepresentation of the facts concerning this country, its climate and the people
               who live in it by writers of the United States and Great Britain, according to <name
                  ref="pers:LW1">Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</name>, speaking before the Canadian club at
               luncheon at the Hudson’s Bay Wednesday. <name ref="pers:LW1">Mrs. Winnifred
                  Reeve</name> said that through books and films written and produced without the
               writing coming into actual contact with this country people of foreign nations have
               obtained distorted ideas of this country. They think Canada is a land of ice and snow
               all the year around, inhabited principally by Esquimos<note type="editorial"
                  resp="pers:LW1">This is an offensive racial slur. Please see our <ref
                     target="doc:note_on_language">note on language</ref>.</note> and wolves.</p>
            <p><name ref="pers:LW1">Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</name>, who is one of the best known of
               Canadian authors, writing under the pen name of <q><name ref="pers:LW1">Onoto
                     Watanna</name></q>, spoke on <q>The Canadian Spirit in Our Literature</q>.</p>
            <p>Canadian authors, because of lack of means to support themselves, have, of necessity,
               to work at other occupations, she said.</p>
            <p><q>These are men of great literary talent and even genius, but those who remain at
                  home instead of going to other countries, are working with the cards stacked
                  against them, under conditions that are discouraging and heart-breaking</q>, <name
                  ref="pers:LW1">Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</name> declared.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <head>Canada Has Suffered</head>
            <p><q>However, the Canadian author has by no means suffered to the extent that Canada
                  itself has through the loss of many of her best authors; for in their places have
                  slipped in the smart charlatans of the pen of other countries, and these have
                  exploited, misrepresented and libelled Canada, both in story and in motion
                  pictures, so that there has gone forth to the world a grotesquely, unveracious and
                  absurd portrayal of our country</q>, she said.</p>
            <p><q>Spread abroad in magazines and books and sprawled upon the screen, we behold our
                  country as one everlasting expanse of ice and snow. I do not recall ever seeing a
                  Canadian screen play that did not specialize on snow as the main product of
                  Canada. Calgary has gone down to dubious fame as a small cowtown of the wild west
                  type. Winnipeg, Montreal, some of our important cities have fared even worse. Our
                  prosperous Canadians are reveled as a sort of cross between lumberjacks and
                  hoboes, and most of our citizens appear in parkas and mukluks, the garb of Arctic
                  regions</q>.</p>
         </div>

         <div>
            <head>Snow, Ice and Indians</head>
            <p>‘‘We do not ride in automobiles and carriages, according to these pictures, but go
               forth on our streets on skis and snowshoes, or are drawn around on dog sleds. There
               is a monotonous similarity in all these pictures of Canada, the same bag of tricks
               rattled over and over again, snow, ice, beautiful Indian maidens, prairie fires,
               noble mounted police, French-Canucks, bears and sleigh dogs, innocent fugitives from
               justice, a lone waste of land and the wolf’s lone howl. To be typically and perfectly
               Canadian, the story must reveal an utterly cold aspect of complete desolation.</p>
            <p><q>Now, of course, in all this pudding it may be you will find a Canadian spirit, it
                  is the kind of spirit that makes a real Canadian hot under the collar, because he
                  knows it is a gross libel upon his native land. I ask you to consider the effect
                  of such stuff upon the world. Thousands of persons see these films and read these
                  stories</q>, she said.</p>
            <p>‘‘I assert that it is of vital importance to Canada that its authors should remain at
               home, not merely because of the honor and the prestige that will reflect upon the
               country, but because of their intrinsic and practical value to Canada. They are
               needed to offset and undo the harm and the injury already done to Canada by others.
               They are needed because no country can hope to achieve greatness without her
               dreamers, and to the clan of dreamers the author pre-eminently belongs.</p>
            <p><q>With very few exceptions, there has come out of Canada thus far, no important
                  literary production, in which a typically Canadian spirit is revealed</q>, <name
                  ref="pers:LW1">Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</name> said. <q>True, there has been a
                  considerable output of stories and poems of mediocre merit. These are, however, of
                  but questionable value. Canada has produced men and women of literary talent and
                  even genius; but many of these, forced to go outside to find a market for their
                  work, have written of the country where they have their residence</q>.<note

         </div>

         <div>
            <head>Work at Disadvantage</head>
            <p>‘‘On the other hand, with scarcely an exception the Canadian author, at home is
               obliged to earn his living at something else, and to do his writing in such spare
               hours as may be left to him. Imagine a doctor, a lawyer, or a man in any of the
               professions or businesses, working all day long at some other employment, and
               attempting to carry on his profession as well. Yet that is exactly what the Canadian
               author at home is doing. It means writing under pressure, when jaded and worn and
               tired. Work produced under such conditions cannot possess the fire, the freshness and
               the charm of a spontaneous piece of writing done when the mood and inspiration was
               upon the author. Writing is essentially a work of the brain and to do it well one
               needs freedom from the one thousand and one cares and interruptions that beset the
               working day.</p>
            <p>‘‘Comparatively speaking, we are a young nation, but we are old enough to recognize
               the thing of value when we possess it, and I do not think that anyone can question
               the statement that literary talent is a national asset more important than mere gold,
               and it is, therefore, hard to estimate the value of a truly great author to his
               country.</p>
            <p><q><name ref="pers:WW2">President Wilson</name> recognized this, when he sent authors
                  as ambassadors to nearly all the courts of Europe</q>, <name ref="pers:LW1">Mrs.
                  Winnifred Reeve</name> said.</p>
