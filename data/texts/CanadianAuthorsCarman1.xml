         <p><title level="m">The Morning Albertan</title>, February 13, 1924</p>


         <p>Calgary has reason to be proud of the fact that the most successful of any of the <name ref="pers:BC2">Bliss Carman</name> recitals in the western cities was the one on
            Friday evening in the Central Methodist church. About 1,500 people packed the church,
            and gave not only a splendid ovation to the Canadian poet, but followed his reading with
            the most rapt and delighted interest.</p>
         <p>Before leaving the city <name ref="pers:BC2">Mr. Carman</name> expressed his
            appreciation and gratitude for the fine reception accorded him in Calgary. He stated
            that it marked the peak of his tour, and that he was unlikely to forget the sunny city
            of the foothills. The poet will spend a couple of days in Banff before returning to
            Vancouver.</p>
         <p><name ref="pers:DD1">Douglas Durkin</name> is the author of a new Canadian novel
            entitled <title level="m">The Magpie</title>, which is causing heated discussion,
            especially in the city of Winnipeg. This despite the fact that the book has been banned
            by some of the critics of that city, who refuse to review it on the ground that it may
            hurt the sensibilities and feelings of Winnipeggers. Under the circumstances we propose
            to read and fully review said <title level="m">The Magpie.</title></p>
         <p>Too many books are ignored or banned because of prejudice, while others are
               <q>boosted</q> and fulsomely praised out of all proportion to their merits. Not
            always are the methods employed for <q>boosting</q> a book ethical or legitimate. We
            know of a case where a certain new writer entered into an agreement with a critic to act
            as her agent. He revised her script, sold it to the publishers, and then proceeded to
            write most of her reviews and to influence other reviewers. One of these reviews, in
            fact, appeared in the <title level="m">Literary Digest</title>,
            <title level="m">International Book Review</title>, and as many critics are like the
            proverbial sheep, it was inevitable that a number of them fell into line and followed
            the lead of the man who was proclaiming his <q>discovery</q> as a work of genius, and
            for which he was receiving a slice of the authorâ€™s royalties.</p>
         <p>This is not legitimate criticism. It is just as if an author were to write his own
            criticisms and reviews. It is not fair to other authors, who must send out their work
            and have it judged through the usual channels. From a financial viewpoint, of course, it
            may prove remunerative to the author who is not possessed with a fine sense of literary
            honor, unless, of course, discovery results, when an exposure and scandal are sure to
            follow.</p>
