            <head>PREFACE</head>
            <p>Chinese cooking in recent years has become very popular in America, and
certain Japanese dishes are also in high favor. The restaurants are no
longer merely the resort of curious idlers, intent upon studying types
peculiar to Chinatown, for the Chinese restaurants have pushed their way
out of Chinatown and are now found in all parts of the large cities of
America. In New York they rub elbows with and challenge competition with
the finest eating palaces. Their patronage to-day is of the very best,
and many of their dishes are justly famous.</p>
            <p>There is no reason why these same dishes should not be cooked and served
in any American home. When it is known how simple and clean are the
ingredients used to make up these Oriental dishes, the Westerner will
cease to feel that natural repugnance which assails one when about to
taste a strange dish of a new and strange land.
<pb n="2" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_2"/>
            </p>
            <p>Bread, butter, and potatoes are never used by the Chinese or Japanese.
Tea is drunk plain, with neither cream nor sugar, but great care should
be used in its brewing. Rice is indispensable, and should be cooked in
that peculiarly delectable fashion of which the Oriental peoples alone
are past masters. The secret of the solid, flaky, almost dry, yet
thoroughly cooked rice lies in the fact that it is never boiled more
than thirty minutes, is covered twenty minutes, never stirred nor
disturbed, and set to dry on back of range when cooked, covered with a
cloth. Mushy, wet, slimy, overcooked rice is unknown to the Chinese and
Japanese. Sweetened rice, as in rice pudding and similar dishes, is
unknown. Rice takes the place of such staples as bread and potatoes.
Syou,<note type="editorial" resp="pers:LW1">Likely soy sauce. <q>時油</q> in Cantonese.</note> sometimes called Soye, is similar to Worcestershire and similar
European sauces. In fact, the latter are all said to be adaptations of
the original Chinese syou, and most of these European sauces contain
<pb n="3" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_3"/>
syou in their makeup. It lends a flavor to any meat dish, and is greatly
esteemed by the Oriental peoples.</p>
            <p>In China, with the exception of rice, bonbons, and so on, food is served
in one large dish or bowl, out of which all eat, using the chopsticks.
Considerable etiquette governs the manner of picking desired morsels
from the main bowls. In high-caste or mandarin families a servant has
his place at the foot of the table, but he stands throughout the meal.
It is his duty to serve at the table the portions from the main dishes
to each individual, and to do what the host generally does for the
comfort of those at table. The other servants waiting on table take
their orders from him, and he is really there as a sort of proxy for the
host.</p>
            <p>In Japan, individual meals are brought in on separate trays to each
person. All sit cross-legged upon the floor before their trays. The
Japanese consider it gross and vulgar to put <pb n="4" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_4"/> food in quantity upon
the plate. The portions are very small, the largest being about the size
of an egg. There is a striving for daintiness and simplicity.</p>
            <p>For this book only such Chinese and Japanese dishes have been selected
as would appeal to the Western palate, and which can be prepared with
the kitchen utensils of Western civilization. Many dishes prepared by
the Chinese cooks in this country are only modifications of their native
dishes. Recipes for the same dish, obtained from different parts of
China, vary considerably. The combinations here given are those which
experience has proved most easily prepared and most palatable.</p>
            <p>The authors advise any one who intends to cook <q>Chinese</q> to go to some Chinese restaurant and taste the various dishes he desires to cook. A
good cook always should know what a dish tastes like before he tries to
cook it. All cooks can tell how the taste of a strange dish reveals to
him <pb n="5" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_5"/>
many things, and it is often possible to guess of what the dish is
composed.</p>
            <p>No cookbooks, so far as the authors know, have ever been published in
China. Recipes descend like heirlooms from one generation of cooks to
another. The recipes included in this book (the Chinese ones, that is)
have been handed down from Vo Ling, a worthy descendant of a long line
of noted Chinese cooks, and himself head cook to Gow Gai, one time
highest mandarin of Shanghai. They are all genuine, and were given as an
especial expression of respect by a near relative of the famous family
of Chinese cooks.</p>

               <head>RULES FOR COOKING</head>
               <div>
                  <head>GENERAL</head>
                  <p>The first and the most important rule for Chinese cooking is
cleanliness, first of the hands, second of the utensils, and third of
the food.</p>
                  <p>Meat should not be washed, but should be rinsed in cold or lukewarm
water and, if necessary, singed over a hot flame and scraped with a
sharp knife.</p>
                  <p>All vegetables and fruit should be washed in cold water,—if
necessary, in fifty different waters.</p>
                  <p>Never use soap to wash saucepans. Use washing soda or sand.</p>
                  <p>All cloths and dish towels should be boiled and rinsed thoroughly.</p>
                  <p>Care must be taken to measure accurately the ingredients of recipes, for the spices and relishes used in Chinese kitchens are exceedingly hot and
pronounced in flavor.</p>
                  <p>To make rich stock for soup use <pb n="10" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_10"/> only a quart of water to every pound of veal,
mutton, or beef bone.</p>
                  <p>To determine whether a fish is fresh, watch that its flesh is firm and thick, its scales glistening, and its eyes prominent.</p>
                  <p>When dropped into a bowl or pan containing cold water, eggs that are
absolutely fresh will immediately sink to the bottom and rest there;
eggs which are not perfectly fresh will stand on end or rise a little.</p>
                  <p>Delicious dishes can be obtained only from the use of the purest and
best quality of ingredients. A good cook needs to be as well a
discriminating purchaser.</p>
                  <p>Glass measures recording pints and quarts of liquid and ounces and
pounds of solids (like sugar), with the fractions thereof, are handy and
sanitary.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>TO BOIL RICE</head>
                  <p>Use an iron pot. Wash the rice thoroughly in many waters, until, in
fact, the water is as clear as for drinking. To one cupful of rice
add<pb n="11" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_11"/>
one and a quarter cupfuls of cold water. Cover tight, and boil slowly
half an hour—no more. On no account stir. Rice should not be
disturbed till it is taken up; that is the secret of the dry, finely
cooked Chinese rice. Set on back of range, covered with a clean cloth or
napkin, until ready to serve. Rice should be served in individual bowls,
replenished as soon as empty throughout the meal. With the Chinese it
takes the place of bread or potatoes. Salt is not added until it is
served.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>TEA</head>
                  <p>The quantity of tea used depends on the quality, and the taste of the individual. Rinse the pot with boiling water before putting in the tea.
The water should just come to a boil—no more. Pour on the tea
leaves. Let it stand for two or three minutes, but on no account must it
be allowed to boil. Strain tea from leaves, and serve pure, if Chinese
tea is used. See more about tea on page 109.</p>

                  <p>One quart of soup stock; one quarter pound of mushrooms; three stalks of celery; one eighth clove of garlic; six water chestnuts; one quarter
pound of vermicelli; one and one quarter teaspoonfuls of salt; one
teaspoonful of syou (Chinese sauce).</p>
                  <p>Have the soup stock boiling hot. Then wash thoroughly in cold water all the above vegetables, and cut in small pieces. Add to the soup one
tablespoonful of syou, and the salt and pepper. Let all boil twenty
minutes; then add the vermicelli and boil fifteen minutes more. Serve
with hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters.</p>

                  <head>YAT KO MAIN</head>
                  <p>One quart of soup stock; one quarter pound of noodles; one and one half teaspoonfuls of salt; one quarter pound of minced ham; one table
<pb n="13" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_13"/>
spoonful of syou; one small onion; one stalk of celery.</p>
                  <p>Boil the noodles until tender—about ten minutes. Then remove from
the hot water, and put in cold water to soak, while preparing the soup.
To one quart of good soup stock add one onion and one stalk of celery,
chopped fine, pepper and salt, and one tablespoonful of syou. Boil ten
minutes. Remove noodles from the cold water, add them to the soup, and
boil for five minutes more. The ham should be shredded. Just before
serving sprinkle it on top.</p>
               </div>
               <div>
                  <head>SOUP STOCK</head>
                  <p>Save all beef, veal, and chicken bones and clean pieces of meat; also the feet of chickens and the giblets. Wash the chicken feet and skin
them, by first scalding in boiling water. Cover all the above with cold
water and let it boil from five to eight hours slowly, with salt to
taste. Drain liquor from bones, and set away to <pb n="14" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_14"/> cool. When cold it
will be a thick jelly, and is used as the foundation for various soups
and gravies.</p>

                  <p>Two and one half pounds of chicken; one quarter pound of lean pork; one quarter pound of dried mushrooms; one dozen lotus seeds; three stalks of
celery; one teaspoonful of salt; one tablespoonful of syou; one onion.</p>
                  <p>Clean a fresh young chicken of about two and one half pounds. Cut off all the flesh; put the bones, with liver and gizzard, into three pints
of cold water, and boil for two hours, adding water if it boils away.
While the stock is boiling, prepare the following: Cut up the chicken
meat into small pieces. Cut up very fine one quarter pound of lean pork.
Wash and soak in lukewarm water one quarter pound of dried mushrooms.
Pull off all the stalks. Peel and cut a dozen lotus seeds or water
chestnuts. Chop three stalks of celery <pb n="15" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_15"/> very fine, and also one
onion. Pour off the liquor from the bones, and strain. Cut up liver and
gizzard fine and return to stock. Add all the ingredients, with one

                  <p>One half pound of bird’s nest; one pint of chicken stock; one quarter pound of cooked breast of chicken; one boiled egg; one quarter pound of
minced ham; one teaspoonful of salt.</p>
                  <p>To make this soup, the bird’s nest is first boiled an hour, then drained and put into cold water. Meanwhile the cooked chicken meat is well
pounded, so as not to be in large or hard pieces, and a cupful of the
cold stock is added to it. Next the bird’s nest is taken from the cold
water and well drained, and added to the soup stock. Boil for half an
hour. Now the chicken meat is added, and also the egg, the latter having
previously been finely <pb n="16" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_16"/>
crumbled. The soup is taken off the fire as it begins to boil again
after the last addition. Before serving, the minced ham is sprinkled on
top.</p>
                  <p>Bird’s nest is a gelatinous substance, a species of seaweed, with which certain Chinese birds, the esculent swallow and the white-backed
swallow, build their nests. It is also found in Java. It is one of the
most delicious of Chinese foods, and esteemed and praised not alone by
the Chinese but by all travelers in the Orient.</p>

giblets; two tablespoonfuls of syou; one and one half teaspoonfuls of
Quong Sang Chong (water chestnut flour).</p>
                  <p>Boil one can of seaweed until it is like thin jelly. Have ready three chicken giblets, chopped very fine, having first boiled them one hour in
a quart of water. Add the seaweed, and boil all together for half an
hour. Strain, then crumble in the yolks of <pb n="17" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_17"/> two hard-boiled eggs,
stir in two tablespoonfuls of syou, and salt to taste. Rub smooth one
and a half teaspoonfuls of Quong Sang Chong in a little cold water, then
add to the soup and stir until it thickens slightly. Serve with a small
piece of seaweed on top that has been soaking in spiced vinegar.</p>

two small onions; three eggs; bit of garlic.</p>
                  <p>No meat or stock is used for this soup. Have ready three pints of
boiling, salted water, with the two tablespoonfuls of syou in it. Add
all of above vegetables (which have been previously washed in cold
water, and cut in small pieces) except the mushrooms and celery. Boil
for fifteen minutes, then add the mush<pb n="18" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_18"/>rooms and celery. Whip up
the three eggs in a little cold water, and drop slowly into the boiling
soup, stirring the soup as it drops, and it will form into fanciful
shapes. Remove at once, and serve.</p>

and stir it slowly into the boiling fat until it thickens and browns.
Add syou, salt, pepper, and a little sugar. In preparing chop sueys and
similar dishes, use this gravy if the mixture is too dry.</p>

slowly stir in one tablespoonful of flour until brown (taking care not
to burn), salt, pepper, and a little sugar, then slowly pour boiling
water, stirring all the time, until you have a smooth, rich gravy. Use

boil, but keep it hot. Now prepare the following sauce: Rub smooth one
tablespoonful of Quong Sang Chong. To a cup and a half of water add one

               <div>
                  <head>SATSUMA SOUP</head>
                  <p>One small chicken; one medium-sized carrot; one pint of satorius
(elephant-ear plant); two white radishes; one quarter pound of dried
mushrooms; one quarter pound of aburage (oil-fried Tofu); one quarter
pound of miso paste (soy bean and rice cheese); one half teaspoonful of
mixed red-pepper spices.</p>
                  <p>To prepare the chicken, separate the meat from the bones; then put bones in cold water and boil slowly for about two hours. Strain, and add the
well-chopped vegetables. (The mushrooms should have been washed, and
soaked in lukewarm water for ten minutes previously.) Boil for one more
hour, then add the chicken meat, cut in very small pieces, salt, spices,
and half a teaspoonful of sugar. Cook all slowly for one hour. This
makes about three pints of soup. It<pb n="72" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_72"/> is better to make it the day before it is to
be used. Soup is always improved by standing over night. The late Mikado
took three or four sips of this soup for breakfast.</p>

                  <head>TORI SHIRU
(Chicken Soup)</head>
                  <p>Two pound chicken (not necessarily young); one half pound of egg
noodles; one half cupful syou sauce; one quarter pound of white
mushrooms; one half dozen water chestnuts; salt, pepper, and sugar.</p>
                  <p>Thoroughly clean and singe the chicken, and scald feet to peel off scabs or skin. Cut giblets in small pieces and the chicken in about six
pieces, and cover with three quarts of cold water. Boil all for about
three hours, according to the age of the chicken. While it is boiling
wash and cut up the vegetables. Now make the egg noodles of flour and
eggs and roll as thin as paper on a floured board, then cut in shapes of
flowers (chrysanthemums, the Japanese prefer), and <pb n="73" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_73"/> leave spread out on the
board to dry. Drain all soup from the bones and bring to a boil. Add
vegetables, salt, pepper, and one teaspoonful of sugar; also the syou
sauce. Boil all for half an hour, then throw in the noodles and cook for
ten minutes. Serve each bowl of soup with one large noodle flower on
top.</p>

                  <p>One and one half pounds of fish (any kind); one quarter pound of fat
pork; one pound of miso paste (bean and rice paste); one half cupful of
syou sauce; one cupful of cooking juice sauce; one small carrot; two
onions; three hard-boiled eggs; two tablespoonfuls of cooked, chopped
ham; pepper, salt, sugar, and spices.</p>
                  <p>To make this soup, any fish of the milder variety can be used, such as cod, haddock, or bass; lobster and shrimps are also good cooked this
way. Have the pork cut into small pieces, and fry a golden brown; then
<pb n="74" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_74"/>
wash the fish and take out all bones, chop up into small pieces, add to
the pork, and fry for a few minutes. Have ready all the vegetables,
cleaned and grated, and put into the pot with the syou and cooking
juice, salt, pepper, and spices. Let it come to a boil, then add the
miso paste, mixed with a pint and a half of boiling water. Stir all well
together, and boil for one hour, adding boiling water if it cooks away.
Strain into soup bowls, and serve with slices of hard-boiled eggs,
sprinkled with chopped parsley and grated ham.</p>

                  <p>Take off all bones and slice the fish daintily in long slices, and then in half-inch dice. Sprinkle with salt, and leave for about fifteen
minutes. Cut radishes in long, even, delicate strips. Boil for a few
minutes, strain, then add half a cupful of syou sauce and two
tablespoonfuls of a fine vinegar. When it boils, drop in the fish
slices. Boil up, then push to back of range, and, covered tight, let it
simmer for half an hour. Grate the peels of half a lemon and half an
orange, and sprinkle over the fish, after having removed it to a hot
platter. Serve with boiled rice.

                  <p>Fifteen large water chestnuts; three quarters pound of sweet potatoes; three tablespoonfuls of vinegar; three quarters pound of sugar; one half
pint of mirin sauce.</p>
                  <p>Peel the skin from fifteen large water chestnuts and slice them very
thin. Boil in lukewarm water for about fifteen minutes. Peel the sweet
potatoes, cut in slices, and dip in ice-cold water three or four times,
changing the water with each dipping. Boil about one quart in an
enameled saucepan, add the vinegar, then throw in the sweet potatoes.
Cover, and boil for about twenty minutes; then, if tender, drain off all
the water and add the sugar, with five tablespoonfuls of warm water and
also the mirin sauce. Add a pinch of salt. Then place over the fire and
add the above prepared water chestnuts. <pb n="94" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_94"/> When the water chestnuts have thoroughly
absorbed the juice, add the strained sweet potatoes, stir with wooden
spoon, taking care not to burn it, and boil until it is firm. Serve hot
or cold–it is better hot.</p>

                  <p>One good-sized hard cabbage; one cupful of syou sauce; one tablespoonful of sugar; one pound of salt pork; one onion; salt and pepper.</p>
                  <p>First boil the salt pork for one hour, then chop it in small pieces.
Select a good hard cabbage without blemishes and wash it thoroughly in
cold water; soak it in water with a handful of salt to kill all possible
vermin. Remove from salted water, and rinse in fresh water, removing all
salt. Carefully cut out the heart and center leaves, making a good-sized
pocket, and fill this space with the chopped pork and one onion chopped
very fine, salt, pepper, and a teaspoonful of goma seeds. Press the
cabbage <pb n="95" xml:id="ChineseJapaneseCookbook1_page_95"/>
leaves back into place, and tie tight in cheesecloth. Have ready a deep
pot of boiling salted water, and in this place the cabbage in the bag.
Cover, and boil slowly for two hours. Remove to a platter, and pour over
it the syou sauce, which has first been boiled. Serve with rice.</p>

peeled and boiled in salted water for twenty minutes, then removed and
allowed to simmer in boiling syou sauce for five minutes longer. They
are also very good stuffed with chopped meat or fish. To stuff one, take
cold meat, chop it very fine, then mix with it two tablespoonfuls of
miso and salt, pepper, and spices, and two tablespoonfuls of syou, and
fill the center. Fish can be used instead of meat; but if fish is used,
add the juice of a lemon.</p>

thin crackers. The process is precisely the same as the Jewish Matzoth

tea is delicious. Coconut milk with flower petals floating in it is
another favorite beverage. Chinese whisky and wine are very strong, and
have a smoky flavor much appreciated by the epicure. Saké, famous
as chief drink of the Japanese, is a sort of rice wine, with a curious
salty-sweet taste to it. It is very good, when once one becomes
accustomed to it.</p>
