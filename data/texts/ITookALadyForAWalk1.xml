                 <l>I took a lady for a walk</l>
                 <l>And all that lady did was—talk!</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She talked about the birds that fly</l>
                 <l>She said we all must some day die</l>
                 <l>And asked me for the reason why</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She said wet laws should be enforced</l>
                 <l>That Doug and Mary were divorced</l>
                 <l>The Prince of Wales had been unhorsed.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She said she got a thrill from Shuler</l>
                 <l>That he and Aimee couldn’t fool-er.</l>
                 <l>The temperature was getting cooler.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She strayed from literature to art.</l>
                 <l>She said the world was getting older;</l>
                 <l>That every winter seemed much colder</l>
                 <l>And girls were getting bold and bolder.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She said she found most men were queer,</l>
                 <l>But one—guess who?--a perfect dear,</l>
                 <l>And murmured that the Spring was near!</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She said the Movies gave her pain</l>
                 <l>That Gilbert’s lure was on the wane,</l>
                 <l>That Clara Bow had gone insane.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She said that Young had been elected</l>
                 <l>That Mary Nolan was inspected;</l>
                 <l>That Lupe Velez had been detected.</l>

              <lg>
                 <l>She raved of virtue versus vice;</l>
                 <l>She said the latter wasn’t nice,</l>
                 <l>But she was safe, for she was wise!</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She talked of Marion’s freckled nose,</l>
                 <l>She said her lisp was just a pose,</l>
                 <l>And that the world was full of woes.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She talked of Norma and the the Stork</l>
                 <l>She said she just adored roast pork</l>
                 <l>And hoped she’d never have to work.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>She talked of Garbo and her lure,</l>
                 <l>And of the rich and of the poor</l>
                 <l>In these days no one could be sure.</l>
              </lg>
              
              <lg>
                 <l>And then she asked if I were well</l>
                 <l>And said she had a psychic smell---</l>
                 <l>At that I shouted: <q>Go to H----!</q></l>
