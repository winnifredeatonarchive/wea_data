               <p>The last rays of sunset were tingeing the land, lingering in splendor above the
                  bay. The waters had caught the golden glow, and, miser-like, seemingly made effort
                  to keep it with them; but, inexorably, the lowering sun drew away its gilding
                  light, leaving the waters a dark green. The shadows began to darken, faint stars
                  peeped out of the heavens, and slowly the day’s last ray followed the sunken sun
                  to rest; and with its vanishment a pale moon stole overhead and threw a seraphic
                  light over all things.</p>
               <pb n="2"/>
               <p>Out in the bay that the sun had left was a tiny island, and on this a Japanese
                  business man, who must also have been an artist, had built a tea-house and laid
                  out a garden. Such an island! In the sorcerous moonlight one might easily believe
                  it the witch-work of an Oriental Merlin. Running in every direction through the
                  island were narrow little <foreign xml:lang="ja">jinrikisha</foreign> roads, which
                  crossed bewildering little creeks, spanned by entrancing bridges. These were round
                  and high, and curved in the centre, and clinging vines and creeping, nameless
                  flowers crawled up the sides and twined about the tiny steps which ascendeded to
                  the bridges. After crossing a bridge shaped thus, a straight bridge is ofrever an
                  outrage to the eye and sense. And all along the beach of this island was pure
                  white sand, which looked weirdly whiter where the moonbeams loitered and played
                  hide-and-seek under the tree-shadows. </p>
               
               
               <p>The seekers of pleasure who made <pb n="3"/>their way out to the little island on
                  this night moored their boats here in the shadows beneath the trees, and drove in
                  fairy vehicles pulled by picturesque runners, clear around the island, under the
                  pine-trees, over miniature brooks, into the mysterious dark of a forest. Suddenly
                  they were in a blaze of swinging, dazzling lights, laughter and music, chatter,
                  the clattering of dishes, the twang of the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >samisen</foreign>, the ron-ton-ton of the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >biwa</foreign>. They had reached the garden and the tea-house. </p>
               <p>Some pleasure-loving Japanese were giving a banquet in honor of the full moon, and
                  the moon, just over their heads, clothed in glorious raiment, and sitting on a
                  sky-throne of luminous silver, was attending the banquet in person, surrounded my
                  myriad twinkling stars, who played at being her courtiers. Each of the guests had
                  his own little mat, table and waitress. They sat in a semicircle, and <pb n="4"
                  />drank the <foreign xml:lang="ja">sake</foreign> hot, in tiny cups that went
                  thirty or more to the pint; or the Kyoto beer that had been ordered for the
                  foreigners who were the chief guests this evening. This is the toast the Japanese
                  made to the moon: <q>May she with us drink a cup of immortality!</q> and then each
                  wished the one nearest him ten thousand years of joy.</p>
               <p>Now the moon-path widened on the bay, and the moon itself expanded and grew more
                  luminous as though in proud sympathy and understanding of the thousand banquets
                  held in her honor that night. All the music and noise and clatter and revel had
                  gradually ceased, and for a time an eloquent silence was everywhere. Huge glowing
                  fire-flies, flitting back and forth like tiny twinkling stars, seemed to be the
                  only things stirring. </p>
               <p>Some one snuffed the candles in the lanterns, and threw a large mat in the center
                  of the garden, and dusted it ex-<pb n="5"/>travagantly with rice flour. Then a
                  shaft of light, that might have been the combination of a thousand moonbeams, was
                  flashed on the mat from an opening in the upper part of the house, and out of the
                  shadows sprang onto the mat a wild, vivid little figure, clad in scintillating
                  robes that reflected every ray of the light thrown on them; and with her coming
                  the air was filled with the weird, wholly fascinating music of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">koto</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="ja">samisen</foreign>.</p>
               
           
               <p>She pirouetted around on the tips of the toes of one little foot, clapped her
                  hands, and curtsied to the four corners of the earth. Her dance was one of the
                  body rather than of the feet, as back and forth she swerved. There was a patter,
                  patter, patter. Her garments seemed endowed with life, and took on a sorrowing
                  appearance; the lights changed to accompany her; the music sobbed and quivered. It
                  had begun to rain! <emph>She</emph> was raining! It seemed almost as if the
                  pitter-patter of <pb n="6"/>her feet were the falling of tiny rain-drops; the sadness of her
                  garments had increased, and now they seemed to be weeping, at first gradually,
                  then faster and still faster, until finally she was a storm––a dark, blowing,
                  lightning storm. From above the light shot down in quick, sharp flashes, the drums
                  clashed madly, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">koto</foreign> wept on and the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">samisen</foreign> shrieked vindictively.</p>
               <p>Suddenly the storm quieted down and ceased. A blue light flung itself against the
                  now slightly swaying figure; then the seven colors of the spectrum flashed on her
                  at once. She spread her garments wide; they fluttered above her in a large
                  half-circle, and, underneath the rainbow of the gown, a girl’s face, of exquisite
                  beauty smiled and drooped. Then the extinction of light––and she was gone.</p>
               <p>A common cry of admiration and wonder broke out from Japanese and foreigners
                  alike. They called for her, clapped, stamped, whistled, cheered. <pb n="7"/>One
                  man’s voice rose above the clatter of noises that had broken loose all over the
                  gardens. He was demanding excitedly of the proprietor to tell him who she was. </p>
               <p>The proprietor, smiling and bowing and cringing, neverthelss would not tell.</p>
               <p>The American theatrical manager lost his head for a moment. He could make that
                  girl’s fortune in America! He understood it was possible to purchase a geisha for
                  a certain term of years. He stood ready on the spot to do this. He was ready to
                  offer a good price for her. Who was she, and where did she live?</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the nerve-scraping dzin, dzin, dzin of a samisen was disturbing the
                  air with teasing persistence. There is something provoking and still alluring in
                  the music of the sami- sen. It startles the chills in the blood like the maddening
                  scraping of a piece of metal against stone, and still there <pb n="8"/>is an
                  indescribable fascination and beauty about it. Now as it scratched and squealed
                  intermittently and gradually twittered down to a zoom, zoom, zoom, a voice rose
                  softly, and gently, insinuatingly, it entered into the music of the samisen. Only
                  one long note had broken loose, which neither trem- blednorwavered. Whenithadended
                  none could say, only that it had passed into other notes as strangely beautiful,
                  and a girl was singing.</p>
               <p>Again the light flashed down and showed her standing on the same mat on which she
                  had danced, her hands clasped, her face raised. She was ethereal, divinely so. Her
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign> was all white, save where the shaft of
                  moonbeams touched the silk to silvery brilliance. And her voice! All the notes
                  were minors, piercing, sweet, melancholy—terribly beautiful. She was singing music
                  unheard in any land save the Oirent, and now for the first time, perhaps,
                  appreciated by the for-<pb n="9"/>eigners, because of that voice—a voice meant for
                  just such a medley of melody. And when she had ceased, the last note had not died
                  out, did not fall, but remained raised, unfinished, giving to the Occidental ears
                  a sense of incompleteness. Her audience leaned forward, peering into the darkness,
                  waiting for the end.</p>
               <p>The American theatrical manager stalked toward the light, which lingered a moment,
                  and died out, as if by magic, as he reached it. But the girl was gone.</p>
               <p><q>By Jove! She’s great!</q> he cried out, enthusiastically. Then he turned to the
                  proprietor. <q>Where is she? Where can I find her?</q></p>
               <p>That man shook his head.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, come, now</q>, the American demanded, impatiently, <q>I’ll pay you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I don’t know. She is gone</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But you know where she lives?</q></p>
               <p>The proprietor again answered in the negative.</p>
               <pb n="10"/>
               <p><q>Now wouldn’t this make one of this country’s squatty little gods groan?</q> the exasperated manager demanded of a younger man who had followed him forward.</p>
               <p><q>She’d be a great card in vaudeville</q>, the young man contented himself with
                  saying.</p>
               <p><q>There’s a fortune in her! I’m going to find her if she’s on this island. Come
                     on with me, will you?</q></p>
               <p>Nothing loath, Jack Bigelow fared forth behind the theatrical man, whom he had
                  never seen before that afternoon, and whom he never expected to see again. They
                  hurried down one of the narrow, shadowy roads that almost made a labyrinth of the
                  island. But fortune was with them. A turn in the road, which showed the waters of
                  the bay not fifty yards ahead, re- vealed just in front of them two figures—two
                  women—both small, but one a trifle taller than her companion. </p>
               <p><q>Hi, there! You!</q> shouted the <pb n="11"/>manager, who, though among a people
                  whose civilization was older than his own, considered them but heathen, and gave
                  them scant courtesy deserved by all so benighted in matters theatrical. The two
                  figures suddenly stopped.</p>
               <p><q>Are you the girl who sang?</q></p>
               <p><q>Yes</q>, came the answer in a clear voice from the taller figure.</p>
               <p>The manager was not slow in coming to the point. <q>Would you like to be rich?</q></p>
               <p>Again the positive monosyllable, uttered with much eagerness.</p>
               
          
               
               <p><q>Good!</q> The manager’s face could not be seen, but his satisfaction was
                  revealed in his voice. <q>Just come with me to America, and your fortune’s
                     made</q>.</p>
               <p>She stood silent, her head down, so that the manager prompted her impatiently,
                     <q>Well?</q></p>
               <p><q>I stay ad Japan</q>, she said.</p>
               <p><q>Stay at Japan!</q> The manager <pb n="12"/>barely controlled himself. <q>Why,
                     you can never get rich in this land. Now look-a-here— I’ll call and see you
                     tomorrow. Where do you live?</q></p>
               <p><q>I don’ want you call. I stay ad Japan</q>. </p>
               <p>This time the manager, seeing a possible fortune escaping him, and having in mind
                  the courtesy due the heathen, delivered himself of a large Christian oath. <q>If
                     you stay here, you’re a fool. You’ll never––</q></p>
               <p>The young man named Bigelow, who had watched the attempted bargaining in silence,
                  broke in with some indignation. <q>Oh, let her go! She’s got a right to do as she
                     pleases, you know. Don’t try to bully her into going to America if she’d rather
                     stay here</q>.</p>
               
               <p><q>Well, I suppose I can’t use force to make her take a good thing</q>, said the
                  manager, ungraciously. He drew out his card-case and handed the girl his card.
                     <q>Perhaps you’ll change <pb n="13"/>your mind after you think about this a
                     bit. If you do, my name and Tokyo address are on that card; just come round and
                     see me. I’m going down to Bombay to look out for some Indian jugglers. I’ll be
                     gone about five months, and will be back in Tokyo before I start out on another
                     trip to China, Corea, and the Philippines, and then off for home</q>.</p>
               <p>The girl took the card and listened in silence; when he finished, she courtesied,
                  slipped a hand into that of her companion, and hurried down the narrow road.</p>
               <p>After the two Americans had made their way back to the tea-garden, the older one
                  at once sought out the proprietor. </p>
               <p><q>You know something about the girl. Come, tell us</q>, he said, imperiously.</p>
               <p>The proprietor was profusely courteous, but hesitated to speak of the one who had
                  danced and sung. Fi-<pb n="14"/>nally he unbent grudgingly. He told the theatrical
                  man and his companion that he knew next to nothing about her. She had come to him
                  a stran- ger, and had offered her services. She refused to enter into the usual
                  contract demanded of most geishas, and in view of her talents he could not afford
                  to lose her. She was attracting large crowds to his gardens by her strange dances.
                  Still he disliked and mis- trusted her. She came only when it suited her whim, and
                  on fetes and oc- casions of this kind he had no means of knowing where she was. It
                  was only by accident she had happened in this evening. Once he had attempted to
                  follow her, but she had discovered him, and made him promise never to do such a
                  thing again, threatening to stay away altogether if he did so. He spoke
                  disparagingly of her:</p>
               <p><q>Beautiful, excellencies! Phow! You cannot see properly in the deceitful light
                     of this honorable moon. A <pb n="15"/>cheap girl of Tokyo, with the blue- glass
                     eyes of the barbarian, the yellow skin of the lower Japanese, the hair of mixed
                     color, black and red, the form of a Japanese courtesan, and the heart and
                     nature of those honorably unre- liable creatures, alien at this coun- try,
                     alien at your honorable country, augustly despicable—a half-caste!</q></p>

               <p>Jack Bigelow was beset by the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakodas</foreign>
                  (professional match-makers). He was known to be one of the richest foreigners in
                  the city, and the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakodas</foreign> gave him no rest.
                  Though he found them interesting, with the little comedies and tragedies to relate
                  of the matches they had made and unmade, he had remained impregnable to their
                  arts. He naturally shrank from such a union, and in this position he was
                  strengthened by a promise he had made to a college chum, before leaving America to
                  aq college chum, his most intimate friend, a young English-Japanese student, named
                  Taro Burton, that during his <pb n="17"/> stay in Japan he would not append his
                  name to the long list of foreigners who for a short, happy, and convenient season
                  cheerfully take unto themselves Japanese wives, and with the same cheerfulness
                  desert them.</p>
               <p>Taro Burton was almost a monomaniac on this subject, and denounced both the
                  foreigners who took to themselves and deserted Japanese wives, and the native
                  Japanese, who made such a practice possible. He himself was a half-caste, being
                  the product of a marriage between an Englishman and a Japanese woman. In this
                  case, however, the husband had proved faithful to his wife and children up to
                  death; but then he had married a daughter of the nobility, a descendant of the
                  proud Jokichi family, and the ceremony had been performed by an English
                  missionary. Despite the happiness of this marriage, Taro held that the Eurasian
                  was born to a sorrowful lot, and was bitterly <pb n="18"/>opposed to the union of
                  the women of his country with men of other lands, particularly as he was
                  Westernized enough to appreciate how lightly such marriages were held by the
                  foreigners. It was true, of course, that after the desertion the wife was
                  divorced, according to the law, but that, in Taro’s mind, only made the matter
                  more detestable.</p>
            
           
               <p>For five years, up to their graduation four months before this, the young American
                  and the young half-Japanese had been associated as closely together as it is
                  possible for two young men to be, and a strong and deep affection existed between
                  them. </p>
               <p>It had been originally decided that the friends would make this trip together,
                  which in Taro Burton’s case was to be his return to the home he had left, and,
                  with Jack bigelow, was to be the beginning of a year’s travel preliminary to
                  entering the business of his father, who was a rich ship-<pb n="19"/>builder. But
                  for some reason, which he never clearly set forth to his friend, Taro had backed
                  out at almost the last minute; yet he had urged Jack to undertake the trip alone,
                  and, under promise to follow shortly, finally had prevailed. So Jack Bigelow had
                  made the long voyage to Japan, and had taken a pretty house of his own a short
                  distance from Tokyo. </p>
               <p>It was unfortunate that Taro could not accompany his friend, for, while the latter
                  was not a weak character, he was easy-going, good-natured, and easily manipulated
                  through his feelings. </p>
               <p>The young Japanese, had he done nothing else, at least would have kept the
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakodas</foreign> and their offerings of matrimonial
                  happiness on the outer side of the American’s door. As it was, one of them in
                  particular was so picturesque in appearance, quaint in speech, and persistent in
                  his calls, that the young man had encouraged his<pb n="20"/>visits, until a
                  certain jocular intimacy put their relations with each other on a pleasant and
                  familiar footing.</p>
               <p>It was this <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> (Ido was his name, as he had
                  told Jack) who brought an applicant for a husband to his house, one day, and
                  besought him at least to hold a look-at meeting with her. </p>
                  <p><q>She is beautiful like unto the sun goddess</q>, he declared, with the
                  extravagance of his class. </p>
               <p><q>The last was like the moon</q>, said the young man, laughing. <q>Have you any stars to
                  trot out?</q></p>
               <p><q>Stars!</q> echoed the other, for a moment puzzled, and then, beaming with
                  delighted enlightenment, <q>Ah, yes—her eyes, her feet, hair, hands, twinkling
                     like unto them same stars! She prays for just a look-at meeting with your
                     excellency</q>. </p>
               <p><q>Well, for the fun of the thing, then</q>, said the other, laughing, <q>I’m sure
                     I don’t mind having a look-at meeting with a pretty girl. Show <pb n="21"/> her
                     into the <foreign xml:lang="ja">zashishi</foreign> (guest-room) and I’ll be
                     along in a moment. But, look here</q>, he continued, <q>you’d better understand
                     that I’m only going through this ceremony for the fun of the thing, mind you. I
                     don’t intend to marry any one—at all events, not a girl of that class</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Nod for a leetle while whicheven?</q> persuaded the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >nakoda</foreign>.</p>
               <p><q>Nod for a leetle while whicheven</q>, echoed the young man, but the agent had
                  disappeared. </p>
               <p>When Jack, curious to know what she was like, she who was seeking him for a
                  husband, entered the <foreign xml:lang="ja">zashishi</foreign>, he found the
                  blinds high up and the sunshine pouring into the room. His eyes fell upon her at
                  once, for the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> at the back of the room was
                  parted, and she stood in the opening, her head drooping bewitchingly. He could not
                  see her face. She was quite small, though not so small as the average Japanese
                  woman, and the two little <pb n="22"/>hands, clasped before her were the whitest,
                  most irresistible and perfect hands he had ever seen. He had heard of the beauty
                  of the hands of Japanese women, and was not surprised to find even a girl of this
                  class—she was a <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign>, of course, he told
                  himself—with such exquisite, delicate hands. He knew she was holding them so that
                  they could be seen to advantage, and her little affected pose amused and pleased
                  him.</p>
               
             
               
               <p>After he had looked at her a moment, she subsided to the mats and made her
                  prostration. She was dressed very gayly in a red craêpe <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >kimono</foreign>, tied about with a purple <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >obi</foreign>. Her hair was dressed after the fashion of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign>, with a flower ornament at top and long, pointed
                  daggers at either side; but as she bowed her head to the mats, some pin in her
                  hair escaped and slipped, and then a tawny, rebellious mass of hair, which was
                  never meant to be worn smoothly, had fallen all about <pb n="23"/>her, tumbled
                  into her eyes and over her ears, and literally covered her little crouching form.
                  She shivered in shame at the mishap, and then knelt very still at his feet. </p>
               <p>Bigelow was speechless. Never before in his life had he seen such hair. It was
                  dark, though not densely so, for all over it, even where it had been darkened with
                  oil, there was a rich red tinge; and it was luxuriously thick and long and
                  wavy.</p>
               <p><q>Good heavens!</q> he said, after the little figure had remained absolutely
                  motionless for a full minute; <q>she’ll hurt or cramp herself in that
                     position</q>.</p>
               <p>The girl did not rise at the sound of his voice, but crept nearer to him, her hair
                  still enshrouding her. It made him feel creepy, and annoyed and pleased and amused
                  him altogether. </p>
               
               <p><q>Don’t do that</q>, he said. <q>Please stand up. Do!</q></p>
               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> told him to lift her to <pb n="24"
                  />her feet, and the young man did so, entangling his hands in her hair. When she
                  stood up, he saw her face, which was oval and rosy, the lips very red. She still
                  drooped her eyes, so that her face was incomplete.</p>
               <p><q>What’s your name?</q> he asked her, gently. <q>What do you want with me?</q></p>
               <p>Now she raised her head and he saw her eyes. They startled him. They were large,
                  though narrow, and intensely, vividly blue. Before, with her hair neatly smoothed
                  and dressed, he had noticed nothing extraordinary about her; now, with that rich
                  red-black hair enshrouding her, and the long, blue eyes looking at him mistily,
                  she was an eerie little creature that made him marvel. A Japanese girl with such
                  hair and eyes! And yet the more he looked at her the more he saw that her clothes
                  became her; that she was Japanese despite the hair and eyes. He did not try to
                  explain <pb n="25"/> the anomaly to himself, but he could not doubt her
                  nationality. There was no other country she could belong to. </p>
               <p><q>You are Japanese?</q> he finally asked, to make sure. </p>
               <p>She nodded.</p>
               <p><q>I thought so; and yet–</q></p>
               <p>She smiled, and her eyes closed a trifle as she did so. She was all Japanese in a
                  moment and prettier than ever.</p>
               <p><q>You see–your eyes and hair–</q> he began again. She nodded and dimpled, and he
                  knew she understood.</p>
               <p><q>What is it you want with me?</q> he asked, desiring rather to hear her speak
                  than to learn her object, for this he knew. </p>
               
              
               
               <p>She was solemn now. She flushed, and her eyes went down. To explain to him why she
                  had come to him in this wise was a painful task. He could guess that, but she
                  forced the words past her lips.</p>
               <p><q>To be your wife, my lord</q>, she <pb n="26"/>said in English, and the queer
                  quality of her voice thrilled him strangely.</p>
               <p>This was the answer he knew was coming; nevertheless it stirred him in a way he
                  had not expected. To have this wonderfully pretty girl before him, beseeching him
                  to marry her–he who had as yet never dreamed of marriage for himself–was
                  disturbing to his balance of mind. Nay, more–it was revolting. He shrank back
                  involuntarily, wondering why she had come to him, and this wonder he put into
                  words.</p>
               <p><q>But why do you want to marry me?</q> he asked.</p>
               <p>The expression of her face was enigmatical now. She had ceased to blush and smile,
                  and had become quite white. Suddenly she commenced to laugh–thrilling, elfish
                  laughter, that rang out through the room, startling the echoes of the house.</p>
               <p><q>Why?</q> he repeated, fascinated.</p>
               <p>She shrugged her shoulders. <q>I mus’ make money</q>, she said.</p>
               <pb n="27"/>
               <p>Of course this was her reason; he knew that before she spoke; but hearing her say
                  so gave him pain. She was such a dainty little body.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, you need not sell yourself for that</q>, he said, earnestly. <q>Why, I’ll
                     give you some–all you want. You’re awfully young, aren’t you? Just a little
                     girl. <emph>I</emph> can’t marry you. It wouldn’t be fair to you</q>.</p>
               <p>Again she shrugged her shoulders, and spoke in Japanese to the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign>. </p>
               <p><q>She says some one else will, then</q>, he interpreted.</p>
               <p><q>All right</q>, said the young man, almost bitterly.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>She pretended to go slowly toward the door, and then came back towards
                  Bigelow.</p>
               <p><q>I seen you before</q>, she announced, ingenuously.</p>
               <p><q>Where?</q> He was curiously interested. He fancied her face familiar.</p>
               <p><q>Ad tea-house</q>.</p>
               <pb n="28"/>
               <p><q>What tea-house?</q></p>
               <p><q>On liddle island. You ’member? I dance like this-a-way</q>. She performed a few
                  steps.</p>
               <p><q>What! you that girl?</q> He knew her in an instant now. <q>How could you
                     remember me?</q></p>
               <p><q>You following me after dance with ’nudder American gent, and before thad some
                     one point ad you–ole wooman thad always accompanying me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>How did <emph>she</emph> know me?</q></p>
               <p><q>She din know you to speag ad, bud–she saying you mos’ reech barbarian ad all
                     Japan</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, I see</q>, he said, coldly.</p>
               <p><q>She tell me I bedder git married with you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Indeed! Why?</q></p>
               <p>She hung her head a moment.<q>Because she know I luffing with you</q>, she
                  said.</p>
               <p><q>You loving with <emph>me!</emph></q> He laughed outright. Her ingenuousness was entrancing.</p>
               <pb n="29"/>
               <p><q>Yes</q>, she said, and he, with masculine conceit, half believed her.</p>
               <p><q>But wouldn’t you rather stay at the tea-house than get married?</q> he asked.</p>
               <p><q>Not nuff money that business</q>, she returned.</p>
               <p><q>Do you do everything for money?</q></p>
               <p><q>How I goin’ live?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This question, answering a question, brought her back to the purpose of her visit.
                  She held her little hands out to him. </p>
               <p><q>Ah, excellency, <emph>pray</emph> marry with me</q>, she begged.</p>
               <p>He took her hands quickly in his own. They were soft and so small. He could
                  enclose them with one of his. They were delightful. He knew they were daintily
                  perfumed, like everything else about her. He did not let them go.</p>
               <p><q>You ought not to marry, you know</q>, he said to her, almost boyishly. <q>How
                     old are you, anyhow?</q></p>
               <pb n="30"/>
               <p>She ignored his question.</p>
               <p><q>I will be true, good wife to you forever</q>, she said, and then swiftly
                  corrected herself, as though frightened by her own words. <q>No, no, I make
                     ridigulous mistage—not forever—jus’ for liddle bit while—as you desire,
                     augustness!</q></p>
               <p><q>But I don’t desire</q>, he laughed nervously. <q>I don’t want to get married. I
                     won’t be over a few months at most in Japan</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, jus’ for liddle bit while marry with me</q>, she breathed,
                     entreatingly—<q>Pl-ease!</q></p>
               <p>It hurt him strangely to have her plead so. She looked delicate and refined and
                  gentle. He put her hands quickly from him. She held them out and put them back
                  again into his. Her eyes clouded, and he thought she was going to cry. </p>
               <p>He was seized with a desire to keep her from weeping, if he could, this little
                  creature, who seemed made for <pb n="31"/>anything but tears. He spoke from this
                  impulse, without giving so much as a second’s thought to the seriousness of his
                  words.</p>
               <p><q>Don’t cry. I’ll marry you, of course, if you want me to</q>.</p>
               <p>He felt the hands in his own tremble. </p>
               <p><q>Thangs, excellency</q>, she said, in a voice that was barely above a whisper,
                  but it was a voice which had in it no note of joy.</p>
               
              
               
               <p>There was pleasure, however, in the eyes of the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >nakoda</foreign>. He had done a good piece of business, a most excellent piece
                  of business, for the American gentleman was reputed to be able to buy hundreds and
                  hundreds of rice-fields if he so cared to do. The <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >nakoda</foreign> came forward with a benignant smile to arrange the terms.</p>
               <p><q>She will cost only three hundred yen per down and fifteen yen each end per
                     week. Soach a cheap price for a wife!</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was the grinning face of this <pb n="32"/>matrimonial middleman that brought
                  Bigelow back to his senses. He had said he would marry this little creature, whose
                  limp hands he was holding. He dropped them as though they were the hands of one
                  dead, and drew back.</p>
               <p><q>I won’t do it!</q> he almost shouted. <q>Never!</q> Then he thought what must
                  be the feelings of the little girl whose yoke of marriage he was refusing, and
                  softened. <q>I wasn’t thinking when I said I would. I wouldn’t be doing right, and
                     it wouldn’t be fair to you</q>. He paused, and then added, lamely, <q>I think
                     I’d like you awfully, though, if I only knew you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But––</q> spoke up the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign>, anxiously, who found his dream of a large fee fading into thin air.</p>
               <p>Jack turned upon him quickly and gave him a sharp look, whereat he retired
                  hurriedly.</p>
               <p>A look of relief had come over the <pb n="33"/>girl’s face when Jack had cried out
                  that he would not marry her, and at this he wondered much. This relief in her
                  face, however, was succeeded almost instantly by disappointment. But she spoke no
                  further word. She gave him a single hurried glance from beneath fluttering
                  eyelashes, curtsied until her head was almost on a level with his knees, and left
                  him.</p>

               <head type="subtitle">An Appointment</head>
               
               
               <p>Jack Bigelow regarded the attempt of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign>
                  and the little Miss——(he had not even thought to ask her name) as an incident
                  closed by the retirement of the one aspiring to wifehood from his sight. But in
                  passing from his house she had not passed from his mind. This she occupied in
                  spite of him, though it must be said that Jack made no effort to eject her.</p>
               <p>He had been approached by many <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakodas</foreign>, who had
                  the disposal of some most excellent wives, so they had told him, but never before
                  had he consented to see one of their offerings; so the sensation of being asked in
                  marriage by a girl whom he had only seen <pb n="35"/> once before, and that under
                  circumstances which prevented his seeing her clearly, was altogether new.That he,
                  John Hampden Bigelow, A.B.—he was very proud of that A.B., it had not cost him any
                  particular labor—should be so sought out was not at all displeasing to his vanity,
                  a quality that he prided himself on not possessing, notwithstanding the fact that
                  he knew he had been approached because he had money. </p>
               <p>He chuckled at the event several times during the day. He would keep this incident
                  in mind, with all its detail, and make use of it now and then after he had
                  returned home, when he was called upon to talk of his experiences in other lands.
                  Of course, he would exaggerate a bit here and tone down a bit there, and would
                  make the girl much prettier. No, the girl was pretty enough. This part of the
                  incident could not be improved upon.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Jack mused about the morning’s <pb n="36"/>episode during the entire day, and
                  twice exploded into such laughter at the idea of his being asked for a husband
                  that his little man hurried in to see if the gray-eyed barbarian was taking leave
                  of his senses. In the evening he grew restless, and, having nothing else to do—so
                  he told himself—he went out to the tea-garden on the little island which he had
                  visited a few nights before. For an hour he waited for something—for something
                  that did not appear. Finally, when the proprietor chanced to pass him, he asked in
                  the manner of one casually interested: </p>
               <p><q>The girl who danced and sang the other night—is she here?</q></p>
               <p>She was not, for which the proprietor humbly asked pardon. She had not visited his poor place since the night the American had seen her.</p>
               <p>For some reason Jack suddenly lost interest in the house and garden, and returned
                  to his home. But the next <pb n="37"/>night—again because he had nothing else to
                  do—found him once more a guest at the tea-garden. This time he did not leave at
                  the end of an hour; possibly because a weird dance was performed and a weird song
                  sung by a girl with vivid blue eyes. He could not see their color from where he
                  sat, but he knew they were blue.</p>
               
              
               
               <p>After that he fell into the habit of visiting the garden every night—these were
                  dull times in Tokyo—never anything else to do. Most of the evenings so spent were
                  intensely wearisome, but some few of them were not. It may only have been only a
                  series of coincidents, but it so happened that on the enjoyable evenings there was
                  a weird dance and a weird song, and on the others there were not the graceful
                  swayings of a lithe body, nor the wonderful music of a wonderful voice. </p>
               <p>One evening, immediately after the song had been ended, he found himself striding
                  down the same road he <pb n="38"/>had taken with the excited theatrical manager,
                  and this without consciously having decided upon such a course. But he came down
                  to the beach without seeing man or woman, and, though he would not acknowledge to
                  himself that he was seeking any one, he carried away with him a keen sense of
                  disappointment.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>For two weeks the dullness of Tokyo remained unabated, so that the evenings
                  offered nothing else to do save to go to the tea-gardens. At the end of that time,
                  Jack, becoming honest with himself, admitted that there was nothing else, because
                  there was nothing else he wanted to do, and while in this frank mood he let it
                  become known to himself that there was nothing in all the Land of the rising sun
                  that held so much of interest to him as did the girl who had offered herself to
                  him for wife—nothing, indeed, in all the other lands of the earth. Why this was,
                  he did not know, not<pb n="39"/>being one given to searching his own soul or the
                  souls of others. </p>
               <p>While he reclined at his ease one afternoon in the little room in which he lounged
                  and smoked, he began to place her, in his imagination, here and there in his
                  house, to try the effect. </p>
               <p>He set her in one of his largest chairs, notwithstanding she would have been much
                  more comfortable on the floor, in this same room, and she added wonderfully to the
                  appearance of things. He stood her pensively by the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >tokonona</foreign>; he nodded his head—very good! He placed her out beneath a
                  cherry-tree in his garden; again he nodded approvingly. And a breakfast with her
                  sitting opposite him! That would be like unto the breakfast eaten by the angels in
                  heaven—if angels partake of other than spiritual nourishment. Yes, she would be
                  wonderfully effective in this little house, would harmonize with it greatly. </p>
               <p>But what an odd figure she would <pb n="40"/>make in an American dress! He thought
                  of her in a golfing costume, and smiled at his fancy. Nevertheless even in the
                  gowns worn by the women of his own country, she would be quaint and charming. She
                  would be awkward, of course, but would be graceful even in her awkwardness. And
                  she would transgress every polite convention, and would make herself all the more
                  delightful in so doing. He compared her to the wives of some of the men he knew,
                  to many of the girls he had met since girls had begun to have interest for him,
                  and his admiration for her grew apace. He would be proud of her, he knew, for she
                  was pretty and would attract attention; men like their wives to be looked at. She
                  was unlike the wife of any of his countrymen he was likely to meet, and this was
                  much.</p>
               <p>What would his parents think? They’d be angry at first, of course, but they’d give
                  in; they loved him, and <pb n="41"/>couldn’t resist her––no one could resist her. Anyhow,
                  this prospective trouble was so far ahead that there was no use in wasting thought
                  upon it now.</p>
               <p>Why the deuce hadn’t he learned her name? It was very monotonous this being
                  compelled to think of her only as <q>she</q> and <q>her</q>.</p>
               <p>But why had she come to him asking him to marry her? He shook his head at that; he
                  didn’t quite like it. But—oh, well, you know, these Japs have no end of queer
                  customs. This incident just illustrated one of them. She was clearly a superior
                  kind of girl. Not an ordinary <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign> as he had
                  thought when his eyes first fell on her. He had seen enough of the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">geishas</foreign> at the tea-houses to know that she was of a
                  different kind; to his Occidental eyes these last were most pleasing creatures,
                  but—</p>
               <p>Just then his man straggled through the room and brought an end to his musing.
                  Marry her? He sat up <pb n="42"/>straight. What had he been thinking about? The
                  idea was absurd. It was absurd for him to think about marrying any one. He got to
                  his feet, called back his man, and ordered a <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >jinrikisha</foreign> to be brought to him. and then rode off to Tokyo to
                  forget all about it.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>But it would not be forgotten. After he had left the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >jinrikisha</foreign> he caught sight of her on the opposite side of the
                  street, turning a corner. He hurried after her, but when he reached the corner she
                  was nowhere to be seen. He looked into all the shops on either side of the street
                  for a distance of a hundred yards, but saw no one who bore the least resemblance
                  to her. Then he tramped about the immediate vicinity, his sense of loss deepening
                  with each minute, until he noticed that the shop-keepers were eyeing him with
                  suspicion. He gave up the search and started back to his <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >jinrikisha</foreign>.</p>
               <p>As he was swinging along disconsolately, his eyes lighted upon another <pb n="43"/>person whom
                  he knew—Ido, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign>—and him Jack did not
                  let escape. He pounced down upon him, and clapped a hand upon his shoulder.</p>
               <p><q>Hallo, there!</q> he called out.</p>
               <p>Ido started back as if he had been set upon by an enemy. He was unused to such
                  emphatic greetings. But when he saw who his assailant was he slipped a smile upon
                  his face, smirked and bowed, and hoped that the august American’s days were filled
                  with joy.</p>
               <p><q>They’ll do</q>, Laurin answered. <q>And how are things with you? Business good?
                     Making any matches?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Ido had introduced four persons to incomparable happiness—which was to say, he had
                  brought about two marriages. Had his lordship come into like happiness?</p>
               <p>No, his lordship had not.</p>
               <p><q>You making gradest mistage you’ whole lifetime</q>, Ido assured him. <q>You nod
                     yit seen Japanese woman <pb n="44"/>that please you for wife? No? I know nodder girl you’
                     excellency nod seen it. Mos’ beautiful in Japan. You like see her?</q></p>
               <p><q>No, I’ve seen enough. By-the-way, Ido, what’s become of the girl you brought
                     around to my house? Married yet?</q> Jack put on a look of indifferent
                  interest.</p>
               <p><q>No, excellency</q>.</p>
               <p>For one disinterested. Jack found very much relief in this answer.</p>
               
               <p><q>But I thing she going be</q>, Ido went on, calmly. <q>Two, three—no, two odder
                     gents—what you say?—consider—yes, consider her</q>.</p>
               <p>These words drove relief from the disinterested Jack’s heart, and instantly set up
                  in its place a raging jealousy. But he compelled himself to remark, quite easily,
                     <q>You don’t say!</q></p>
               <p>Ido confirmed his statement with a nod that was almost a bow.</p>
               <p><q>A very pretty girl</q>, Jack commented, loftily. </p>
               <pb n="45"/>
               <p>Ido’s reply was confined to a mere <q>Yes</q>. There was no use going into
                  ecstasies when no bargain was in sight. </p>
               <p><q>I think I’ll go around to see her, and congratulate her</q>, Jack went on.
                     <q>Where does she live?</q></p>
               <p><q>I regretfully cannot tell</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Ah, well, let it go then. But say, I really would like to see her again before
                     she’s married. Rather took a fancy to her, you know. Couldn’t you bring her out
                     to call on me to-morrow morning?</q></p>
               <p><q>I going be very busy to-morrow</q>. Seeing no chance of earning a marriage-fee,
                  he saw no reason for taking the trip.</p>
               <p><q>I’ll pay you for your trouble—needn’t worry about that</q>.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Ido could arrange to come: yes, now that he thought again, he knew he
                  could come. </p>
               <p>So it was settled that he and the girl should visit Jack at ten o’clock the next
                  day.</p>

               <p>The announcement of his man that Ido and his charge had arrived contained no news
                  for Jack, for he had been watching the road from Tokyo since nine o’clock, and had
                  seen them while they were yet afar off. Nevertheless he did not enter the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">zashishi</foreign> until his man came to him with the word that
                  guests from the city were awaiting him, and then he had no definite idea of what
                  he intended to do.</p>
               <p>She was dressed exactly as she had been on her previous visit, and she made
                  obeisance almost to the floor, in greeting him, as she then had done. He hastened
                  her recovery from the deep courtesy by taking her hands <pb n="47"/>and raising her to an
                  upright posture.</p>
               <p><q>You have come to see me again? I am very glad to see you</q>, he said, with
                  eager potlieness.</p>
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Nakoda</foreign> say you wish see me. Tha’s why I
                     come</q>. There was not a trace of her former coquetry in her manner.</p>
               <p><q>Yes, I had to send Ido after you. I don’t suppose you would never have let me
                     see you again if I had not</q>.</p>
               <p>She shrugged her shoulders imperceptibly. <q>Me you don’ wish marrying with. You
                     send me ’way. What I do?</q>
               </p>
               <p><q>We could be capital friends, even if we didn’t care to marry, couldn’t
                  we?</q></p>
               <p><q>Frien’? I don’ wan’ frien’</q>, she returned, coldly.</p>
               <p><q>But I’d like to have you for my friend, all the same, though I’m afraid it’s
                     not possible. Ido</q>—he hesitated—<q>Ido says you’re going to be married, you

               <pb n="48"/>
               <p>She inclined her head.</p>
               <p><q>You’re not married yet, are you?</q> he asked in alarm, forgetting that he had
                  put this same question to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> the day
                  before.</p>
               <p><q>Nod yit</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Do you—um—like him?</q></p>
               <p><q>Which one, my lord?</q> She looked up at him innocently.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, both of them!</q> He was beginning to get angry. He would find pleasure in
                  laying violent hands upon the two, one at a time.</p>
               <p><q>Jus’ liddle bit, augustness</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Better than you do me?</q> he demanded, jealously.</p>
               <p>She shook her head decisively. <q>You nod so ole, an nod so—hairy-like</q>. She
                  rubbed her little hands over her face, by which he understood that the two wore
                  beards. They were doutless of his own country.</p>
               <p>He hardly knew what to say next, and the silence grew embarrassing to him. She
                  broke it by remarking, quietly: <pb n="49"/></p>
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Nakoda</foreign> inform me you wan’ make liddle bit talk
                     ad me</q>.</p>
               
            
               
               <p>He turned to the match-maker, who was pretending deep interest in a framed drawing on the wall. <q>Say, Ido, just step into the next room a minute, will you?</q></p>
               <p><q>You have never even told me your name</q>, he said.</p>
               <p><q>Yuki</q>.</p>
               <p><q>That means ‘Snowflake,’ doesn’t it? I like it. Well now, Yuki, mayn’t I visit
                     you at your home, before you are married?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was anxious to see what her people were like, and how she lived.</p>
               <p><q>Mos’ poor house in all Tokyo—so liddle bit house augustness nod lige
                  come</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But I don’t care if it is. I want to come anyhow. I want to see you, not the
                     house. Won’t you tell me where you live?</q></p>
               <pb n="50"/>
               <p>She shook her head. <q>No</q>, she said with simple directness, and then added as an
                  as an after-thought, <q>House too small. You altogedder too big to enter thad liddle bit
                  insignificant hovel</q>.</p>
               <p>Her answer gave him offence. He wondered why she should dissemble, wondered wether
                  she was laughing at him. A glance at her, however, and his distrust vanished. She
                  seemed such a simple little body, yet he knew he did not understand her. </p>
               <p>Her eyes, which she had kept turned downward, slowly uplifted and looked
                  questioningly into his own. Such wonderful eyes! Such a simple, exquisite face! He
                  was suddenly suffused with a great wave of tenderness, and he bent low and gently
                  made prisoners of her hands. However indefinite his purpose had been up to this
                  time, it was definite enough now.</p>
               <p><q>So you remember, Yuki, what you asked me when you were here before?</q></p>
               <pb n="51"/>
               <p><q>Yes</q>. She still gazed at him questioningly.</p>
               <p><q>Would you like to—would you rather marry me than one of those other
                     fellows?</q> he said, softly.</p>
               <p><q>Yes</q>, again, in the smallest voice this time.</p>
               <p>He hesitated, and she asked, quickly <q>You <emph>wan’</emph> me do so?</q></p>
              <p><q>That’s just what I want, Yuki, dear</q>, he whispered, drawing her hands up to his lips.</p>
               <p><q>All ride</q>. She trembled—perhaps shivered is the better word—as she said
                  this, but gave no other sign of emotion.</p>
               
              
               
               <p>Before Jack could so much as touch his lips to her forehead, Ido entered smiling
                  his professional blessing. It was evident that in the other room he had found no
                  drawing to distract his attention, and a large new peephole in the immaculate
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> indicated where he had given all his
                  eyes and ears to what was going on, and he could wait no longer to press his
                  claim. </p>
               <pb n="52"/>
               <p>Jack, seeing an unpleasant duty before him, and desiring to have done with it at
                  once, told Yuki that he would be back in a minute, and led the <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> into the room out of which he had just come. </p>
               <p>Ido immediately began to make terms. This part was loathsome to the young man.</p>
               <p><q>Why</q>, he said, hotly, <q>if we’re to be married she can have all she wants and needs</q>.</p>
               <p>That wouldn’t do, the wary <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> told him,
                  warily. There would have to be a marriage settlement and a stated allowance agreed
                  upon. He would have to pay more, also, as she was a maid and not a widow. Laurin
                  made no effort to conceal his disgust, and to have the bargaining over with at
                  once agreed to the sums the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign> mentioned. Ido
                  was to have two hundred dollars, and the girl was to receive a weekly allowance of
                  fifteen dollars.</p>
               <p>When the ugly terms of the agreement were completed, the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >nakoda</foreign> bowed himself out, and Jack went back to Yuki. He found her
                  changed; her simplicity had left her, and her coquetry had returned. She stood off
                  from him, and he felt constrained and awk-<pb n="53"/>ward. After a time she
                  demanded of him, with a shrewd inflection in her voice: </p>
               <p><q>You goin’ to lige me, excellency?</q></p>
               <p><q>No question of that</q>, he answered promptly, smiling.</p>
               <p><q>No</q>, she repeated; <q>tha’s sure thing</q>, and then she laughed at her own
                  assurance, and she was so pretty he wanted to kiss her, but she backed from him in
                  mock alarm. </p>
               <p><q>Tha’s nod ride</q>, she declared, <q>till we marry</q>.</p>
               <p><q>God speed the day!</q> he said, with devout joyousness. Still approaching her,
                  as she backed from him, he questioned her boyishly: </p>
               <p><q>And you? Will you like me?</q></p>
               
             
               
               <p>She surveyed him critically. Then she nodded emphatically. They laughed together
                  this time, but when he approached her she grew fearful. He did not want to
                  frighten her.</p>
               <p><q>You god nod anudder wife?</q> she asked.</p>
               <pb n="54"/>
               <p><q>No! Good heavens!</q></p>
               <p><q>I god nod anudder husban’</q>, she informed him, complacently.</p>
               <p><q>I should hope not</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Perhaps</q>, she said, <q>you marrying with girl in Japan thad god married
                     before. Me? I <emph>never</emph></q>.</p>
               <p><q>No, of course not</q>. He didn’t quite understand what she was driving at.</p>
               <p>Then she said: <q>You pay more money ad liddle girl lige me whad nod been marry
                     before?</q></p>
               <p>He recoiled and frowned heavily at her.</p>
               <p><q>I settled that matter with the <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign></q>, he
                  said, coldly. </p>
               <p>Seeing he was displeased, she tried to conciliate him. She smiled at him,
                  engagingly, coaxingly.</p>
               <p><q>You don’ lige me any more whicheven</q></p>
               <p>But his face did not clear up. She had hurt him deeply by her reference to money.</p>
               <pb n="55"/>
               <p><q>Perhaps you don’ want me even</q>, she suggested, tentatively. <q>I bedder go
                     ’way. Leave you all ’lone</q>.</p>
               <p>She turned and was making her way slowly out of the room when he sprang
                  impetuously after her. </p>
               <p><q>Don’t, Yuki!</q> he cried, and caught her eagerly into his arms. She yielded
                  herself to his embrace, though she was trembling like a little frightened child.
                  For the first time he kissed her.</p>
               <p/>
               <p>After she had left him, he stared with some wonder at the reflection of himself in
                  a mirror. So he was to be married, was he? Yes, there was no getting out of it
                  now. As for that, he didn’t want to get out of it—of this he was quite sure. He
                  was very well content—nay, he was enthusiastically happy with what the future
                  promised.</p>
               <p>But his happiness might have been felt in less measure if his eyes, instead of
                  staring at his mirrored likeness, could have been fixed on Yuki.<pb n="56"/> She
                  had borne herself with a joyous air to the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >jinrikisha</foreign>, but once within it, and practically secure from
                  observation, the life had seemingly gone out of her. The brown of her skin had
                  paled to gray, and all the way to Tokyo her eyes shifted neither to right nor
                  left, but stared straight ahead into nothingness, and once, when Ido looked down,
                  he found that they were filled with tears.</p>

               <head type="subtitle">In Which the East and the West Are United</head>
            
               <p>A few days later they were married. It was a very quiet little tea-drinking
                  ceremony, and, unlike the usualy Japanese wedding, there was not the painful crowd
                  of relatives and friends attendant. In fact, no one was present, besides
                  themselves, save Jack’s man and maid and the <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >nakoda</foreign>, while Yuki herself sang the marriage song.</p>
               <p>They started housekeeping in an ideal spot. Their house, a bit of art in itself,
                  was built on the crest of a small hill. On all sides sloped and leaned green
                  highlands, rich in foliage and warm in color. Beyond these smaller hillocks
                  towered the jagged <pb n="58"/>background of mountain-peaks, with the halo of the
                  skies bathing them in an eternal glow. A lazy, babbling little stream dipped and
                  threaded its way between the hillocks, mirroring on its shining surface the beauty
                  of the neighboring hills and the inimitable landscapes pictured on the canvas of
                  God—the skies—and seeming like a twisted rainbow of ever-changing and brilliant
                  colors. But no surges disturbed its waters, even far beyond where it emptied into
                  the mellow Bay of Tokyo.</p>
               <p>From their elevation on the hill they could see below them the beautiful city of
                  Tokyo, with its many-colored lights and intricate maze of streets. And all about
                  them the hills, the meadows, the valleys and forests bore eloquent testimony to
                  the labor of the Color Queen. </p>
               <p>Pink, white, and blushy-red twigs of cherry and plum blossoms, idly swaying, flung
                  out their suave fra-<pb n="59"/>grance on the flattered breeze, the volatile
                  handmaid of young May, who had freed all the imprisoned perfumes, unhindered by
                  the cynic snarl of the jealous winter, and with silent, pursuasive wooing had
                  taught the dewy-tinctured air to please all living nostrils. So from the glowing
                  and thrilling thoughts that tremble on the young tree of life is love distilled,
                  and, unmindful of the assembling of the baffled powers of cold caution and warning
                  fear, the heart is filled with fountain tumults it cannot dissemble.</p>
               <p>Jack Bigelow was fascinated and bewildered at the turn events had taken. He was
                  very good and gentle to her, and for several days after the ceremony she seemed
                  quite happy and contented. Then she disappeared, and for a week he saw nothing of
                  her. </p>
               <p>He greatly missed her—his little bride of three or four days. He longed ardently
                  for her return, and her absence alarmed him. Her little arts and <pb n="60"
                  />witcheries had grown on him even in this short period of their acquaintance. </p>
               <p>Toward the end of the week she slipped into the house quietly, and then went about
                  her household duties as though nothing unusual had occurred. She did not offer to
                  tell him where she had been, and he felt strangely unwilling to force her
                  confidence.</p>
               <p>Instead of becoming better acquainted with her, each day found him more puzzled
                  and less capable of knowing or understanding her. Now she was clinging, artless,
                  confiding, and again shrewd and elfish. Now she was laughing and singing and
                  dancing as giddily as a little child, and again he could have sworn she had been
                  weeping, though she would deny it stoutly, and pooh-pooh and laugh away such an
                  idea.</p>
               <p>He asked her one day how she would like to be dressed in American clothes. She
                  mimicked him. She mimicked everything and every one, from the <pb n="61"/>warbling of the
                  birds to the little man and maid who waited on them.</p>
               <p><q>I loog lige this</q>, she said, and humped a bustle under her ridiculously
                  tight <foreign xml:lang="ja">omeshi</foreign>, and slipped his large sun hat over
                  her face. Then she laughed out at him, and flung her arms tightly about his
                  neck.</p>
               <p><q>You wan’ me be American girl?</q></p>
               <p><q>You are a witch, Yuki-<foreign xml:lang="ja">san</foreign></q>, he said.</p>
               <p><q>I wan’ new dress</q>, she returned, promptly, and held a pink little palm out.
                  He frowned. He almost disliked her when she spoke of money. He filled her hands,
                  however, with change from his pockets, and when she broke away from him, which she
                  did as soon as she had the money, he wanted to take it back. Her pretty laughter
                  sifted out to him through the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> at the other side, and he knew she was mocking
                  him again.</p>
               <p><q>It is her natural love of dress and finery</q>, he told himself. <q>It is the <pb n="62"/>eternal feminine in her, and it is bewitching</q>.</p>
               <p>The next day, as she sat opposite to him, eating her infinitesimal bit of a
                  breakfast—a plum, a small fish, and a tiny cup of tea—all on a little black
                  lacquer tray, he announced mysteriously that he was going <q>on business</q> to the
                  city. </p>
               <p>She desired to accompany him, as became a dutiful wife. </p>
               <p>No, he told her, that was impossible. His mission was of a secret nature, which
                  could not be divulged until his return. </p>
               <p>Then she insisted that she would follow behind him after the manner of a slave;
                  and when he laughed at her, she begged quite humbly and gently that he would
                  condescend to honorably permit her to go with him, and then he was for telling her
                  his whole pretty story, and the surprise he had concocted to please her, when she
                  grew capricious and insisted that she would <pb n="63"/>not stir one little bit of an inch from the house, and that he must go all alone to the city and attend to his great, magnificent business!</p>
               <p>He went down to Tokyo, and in his boyish, blundering fashion he purchased silk and
                  crêpe and linen sufficient for fifty gowns for her. </p>
               <p>She thanked him extravagantly. She could not imagine what she would do with so
                  much finery. Her honorable person was augustly insignificant, and could not
                  accommodate so much merchandise. </p>
               <p><q>Now</q>, he thought with inward satisfaction, <q>that ghost of a money question
                  will be laid. She has everything she wants and shall have. I want to do for her, and
                  give her things without being wheedled into it. It is that which irritates me</q>. </p>
               <p>But a few days later she came to him breathless and flustered. Lo! some one had
                  stolen all the beautiful goods he had bought her. It was <pb n="64"/>neither their
                  man nor maid. No, no! that was altogether impossible. They were honest, simple
                  folk, who feared the gods. But they were all quite gone—where she could not say.
                  Who had taken them, she could not guess. Perhaps she, her unworthy self, and he,
                  his honorable augustness, had been extremely wicked in their former state, and the
                  gods were now punishing them in their present life. It would be wicked and
                  unavailing to attempt to search for the missing goods. It was the will of the
                  gods. Maybe the gods had been offended at such ruthless extravagance. Ah, yes,
                  that was a better solution of the theft. Of course the gods were angry. What gods
                  would not be? It was sinful to buy so many things at once. </p>
               <p>She affected great distress over the loss, and her husband, somewhat bewildered at
                  her elaborate apologies for the thief who had stolen them, tried to comfort her by
                  saying he would<pb n="65"/>buy her double the quantity again, whereat she became very solemn. </p>
               <p><q>No, no</q>, she said. <q>Bedder give me money to buy. I will purchase jus’ liddle bit
                  each time—to please the gods</q>.</p>

               <p>The man in the hammock was not asleep, for in spite of the lazy, lounging
                  attitude, and the hat which hid the gray eyes beneath, he was very much awake, and
                  keenly interested in a certain small individual who was sitting on a mat a short
                  distance removed from him. He had invited her several times to reduce that
                  distance, but up to present she had paid no heed to his suggestion. She was
                  amusing herself by blowing and squeezing between her lower lip and teeth the berry
                  of the winter cherry, from which she had deftly extracted the pulp at the stem.
                  She continued this strange occupation in obstinate indifference to<pb n="67"/>the persuasive
                  voice from the hammock.</p>
               <p><q>I say, Yuki, there’s room for two in this hammock. Had it made on purpose</q>.</p>
               <p>She continued her cherry-blowing without so much as making a reply, though one of her blue eyes looked at him sideways and then solemnly blinked.</p>
               <p><q>What’s the matter, Yuki? Got the dumps again, eh?</q></p>
               <p>No reply.</p>
               <p><q>Look here, Mrs. Bigelow, I’ll come over and elope
                     forcibly with you if you don’t obey me</q>.</p>
               <p>She dimpled scornfully.</p>
               <p><q>Ah, that’s right! Smile, Yuki. You’re so pretty, so bewitching, so irresistible
                     when you smile</q>.</p>
               
               
               <p>Yuki nodded her head coolly. </p>
               <p><q>How you lige me smiling forever?</q> she suggested.</p>
               <p><q>That wouldn’t do</q>, he said, grinning at her from beneath his tipped hat.
                     <q>That would be tiresome</q>.</p>
                  <pb n="68"/>
               <p><q>Tha’s why I don’ smiling to-day</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Why?</q></p>
               <p><q>All yistidy I giggling</q>.</p>
               <p>He shouted with laughter at her.</p>
               <p><q>Move your mat here, Yuki</q>, indicating a spot close to his hammock. <q>I want
                     to talk to you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>My ears are—</q></p>
               <p><q>Too small to hear from that distance</q>, finished her husband.
                  <q>Come</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Thangs</q>, with great dignity, <q>I am quite comfor’ble. I don’ wan’ sit so
                     near you, excellency</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Why, pray?</q></p>
               <p><q>Why? Hm! I un’erstan’. Tha’s because I jus’ your liddle bit slave</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You’re my wife, you little bit fraud!</q></p>
               <p><q>Wife? Oh, I dunno</q>. She pretended to deliberate.</p>
               <p><q>Then you’ve tricked me into a false marriage, madam</q>, declared her husband,
                  with great wrath.</p>
               <p><q>Tha’s fault <foreign xml:lang="ja">nakoda</foreign></q>.</p>
               <p><q>What is?</q></p>
                  <pb n="69"/>
               <p><q>Thad you god me for wife, and</q>, slowly, <q>servant</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Fault! Come here, servant, then. Servants must obey</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Nod so bad master, making such grade big noises</q>, she laughed back daringly.
                     <q>Besides, servant must sit long way off from master</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And wife?</q></p>
               <p><q>Oh, jus’ liddle bit nearer</q>. She edged perhaps half an inch closer to him.
                     <q>Wife jus’ liddle bit different from servant</q>.</p>
               
               <p><q>Look here, Mrs. Bigelow you’re not living up to your end of the contract. You
                     swore to honor and obey—</q></p>
               <p>She laughed mockingly.</p>
               <p><q>Yes you did, madam!</q></p>
               <p><q>I din nod. Tha’s jus’ ole Kirishtan marriage</q>.</p>
               <p>He sat up amazed. <q>What do you know of the Christian marriage service?</q></p>
               <p><q>Liddle bit</q>.</p>
                  <pb n="70"/>
               <p><q>Come over here, Yuki</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You like me sing ad you?</q></p>
               <p><q>Come over here</q>.</p>
               <p><q>How you like me danze?—liddle bit summer danze?</q></p>
               <p><q>Come over here. What’s a summer dance, anyhow?</q></p>
               <p>She ran lightly indoors, and was back so soon that she seemed scarcely to have
                  left him. She had slipped on a red-and-yellow flimsy <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >kimono</foreign>, and had decked her hair and bosom with flaming poppies.</p>
               <p><q>Tha’s summer sunshine</q>, she said, spreading her garment out on each side
                  with a joyous little twirl. <q>I am the Sun-goddess, and you?—you jus’ the col’,
                     dark earth. I will descend and warm you with my sunshine</q>. For a moment she
                  stood still, her head thrown back, her face shining, her lips parted and smiling,
                  showing the straight little white teeth within. Then she danced softly,
                  ripplingly, back and forth. The summer winds were sigh-<pb n="71"/>ing and laughing with her.
                  Her face shone out above her lightly swerving figure, her little hands and bare
                  arms moved with inimitable grace.</p>
               <p><q>You are a genius</q>, he said to her, when she had subsided, light as a feather
                  blown to his feet.</p>
               <p><q>Tha’s sure thing</q>, she agreed, roguishly.</p>
               
               <p>Her assurance in herself always tickled him immensely. He threw his hat at her
                  with such good aim that it settled upon her head. She approved his clever shot,
                  laughed at him, and then, pulling it over her eyes, lay down on the mats and
                  imitated his favorite attitude to a nicety. He laughed uproariously. He was in
                  fine humor. They had been married over a month now, and she had not left him save
                  that first time. He was growing pretty sure of her now.</p>
               <p>She perceived his good-humor, and immediately bethought herself to take advantage.
                  She put the rim of his hat <pb n="72"/>between her teeth, imitated a monkey, and crawled
                  toward him, pretending to beg for her performance. He stretched out his long arms
                  out and tried to reach her, but she was far enough off to elude him.</p>
               <p><q>You godder pay</q>, she said, <q>for thad nize entertainments I giving
                  you</q>.</p>
               
               <p>He threw her a sen. She made a face. <q>That all?</q> she said, in a dreadfully
                  disappointed voice; but despite her acting he saw the greedy eagerness of her
                  eyes. All the good-humor vanished.</p>
               <p><q>Look here, Yuki</q>, he said, with a disagreeable glint in his eyes, <q>you’ve
                     had a trifle over thirty dollars this week. I don’t begrudge you money, but
                     I’ll be hanged if I’m going to have you dragging it out of me on every occasion
                     and upon every excuse you can make. You have no expenses. I can’t see what you
                     want with so much money, anyhow</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I gotter save</q>, said Yuki, myste-<pb n="73"/>riously, struck with this brilliant excuse
                  for her extravagance.</p>
               <p><q>What for?</q></p>
               <p><q>Why, same’s everybody else. Some day I nod have lods money. Whad I goin’ do then? Tha’s bedder save, eh?</q></p>
               <p><q>I’ve married you. I’ll never let you want for anything</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, you jus’ marry me for liddle bit while</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You’ve a fine opinion of me, Yuki</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Yes, fine opinion for you</q>, she repeated after him.</p>
               <p><q>There’s enough money deposited in a bank in Tokyo to last you as long as you live. If it’s ever necessary for me to leave you for a time you will not want for anything, Yuki</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But</q>, she said, argumentatively, <q>when you leaving me I henceforward a
                     widder. I nod marry with you any longer. Therefore, I kin nod take your
                     money</q>. This last with heroic pride.</p>
               <p><q>Boo! Your qualms of conscience<pb n="74"/>about using my money are, to say the
                     least, rahter extraordinary</q>.</p>
               <p><q>When you leaving me—</q> she commenced again.</p>
               <p><q>Why do you persist in that? I have no idea of leaving you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What!</q> She was quite frightened. <q>You goin’ stay with me forever!</q> There was far more fear than joy in her voice.</p>
               <p><q>Why not?</q> he demanded, sharply, watching her with keen, savage eyes.</p>
               <p><q>My lord</q>, she said, humbly, <q>I could nod hear of thad. It would be wrong.
                     Too grade sacrifice for you honorable self</q>.</p>
               <p>He was not sure whether she was laughing at him or not.</p>
               <p><q>You needn’t be alarmed</q>, he said, gruffly; <q>I’m not likely to stay here forever</q>. He turned his back on her.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he felt her light little hand on his face. She was standing close by the
                  hammock. He was still very angry and sulky with her. He closed<pb n="75"/>his eyes
                  and frowned. He knew just how she was looking; knew if he glanced at her he would
                  relent ignominiously. She pried his eyes gently open with her fingers, and then
                  kissed them, as softly as a tiny bird might have done. Gradually she crawled into
                  the hammock with him, regardless of non-assistance.</p>
               
               <p><q>Augustness</q>, she said, her arms about his neck now, though she was sitting up and leaning over him, <q>Listen ad me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I’m listening</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Look ad me</q>.</p>
               <p>He looked, frowned, smiled, and then kissed her. She laughed under her breath,
                  such a queer, triumphant, mocking small laugh. It made him frown again, but she
                  kissed the frown into a smile once more. Then she sat up.</p>
               <p><q>Pray excuse me. I wan’ sit ad your feet and talk ad you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Can’t you talk here?</q> he demanded, jealously.</p>
                  <pb n="76"/>
               <p><q>Nod so well. I gittin’ dazzled. Permit me</q>, she coaxed. He released her
                  grudgingly. She sat close to him on the floor. She sighed heavily,
                  hypocritically.</p>
               <p><q>What is it now?</q></p>
               <p><q>Well, you know I telling you about those moneys?</q></p>
               <p><q>Yes</q>, he said, wearily. <q>Let’s shut up on this money question. I’m sick of
                     it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I lige make confession ad you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Well?</q></p>
               <p><q>I god seventeen brudders and sisters!</q> she said, with  slow and solemn emphasis.</p>
               <p><q>What!</q> He almost rolled out of the hammock in his amazement.</p>
               
               <p><q>Seventeen!</q> She nodded with ominous tragedy in her face and voice.</p>
               <p><q>Where do they live?</q></p>
               <p><q>Alas! in so poor part of Tokyo</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And your father and mother?</q></p>
               <p><q>Alas! Also thad fadder an’ mudder so ole lige this</q>. She illustrated, <pb
                     n="77"/>bowing herself double and walking feebly across the floor, coughing
                  weakly.</p>
               <p><q>Well?</q> he prompted sharply.</p>
               <p><q>I god take all thad money thad ole fadder an mudder an’ those seventeen liddle
                     brudders an sisters. Tha’s all they god in all the whole worl</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But don’t any of them work? Aren’t any of them married? What’s the matter with them all?</q></p>
               <p><q>Alas! NO. All of them too young to worg or marry, excellency</q>.</p>
               <p><q><emph>All</emph> of them too young?</q></p>
               
               <p><q>Yes. Me—how ole <emph>I</emph> am? Oldes’ of all! I am twenty-eight—no, thirty
                     years ole</q>, she declared, solemnly.</p>
               <p> He nearly collapsed. He knew she was a mere child; knew, moreover, that she was lying to him. She had done so before.</p>
               <p><q>Even if you are thirty, I fail to see how you can have seventeen brothers and
                     sisters younger than yourself</q>.</p>
               <p>She lost herself a moment. Then she <pb n="78"/>said, triumphantly, <q>My fadder have two wives!</q></p>
               <p>He surveyed her in studious silence a moment. Her attitude of trouble and despair
                  did not deceive him in the slightest. Nevertheless, he wanted to laugh outright at
                  her, she was such a ridiculous fraud.</p>
               <p><q>Do you know what they’d call you in my country?</q> he said, gravely.</p>
               <p>She shook her head.</p>
               <p><q>An adventuress</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Ah, how <emph>nize!</emph></q> She sighed with envious blissfulness. <q>I wish
                     I live ad your country—be adventuresses</q>.</p>
               
               <p><q>How much do you want now, Yuki?</q></p>
               <p>She pretended to calculate on his fingers. </p>
               <p><q>Twenty-five dollars</q>, she announced.</p>
               <p>He gave it to her and she slipped it into the bosom of her <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign>. He watched her curiously, wondering what she did with all the money she secured from him.</p>
               <pb n="79"/>
               <p>All of a sudden she put this question to him. </p>
               <p><q>Sa-ay, how much it taking go ad America?</q></p>
               <p><q>How much? Oh, not much. Depends on how you go. Four hundred, or five hundred
                     dollars, possibly</q>.</p>
               <p>She groaned. <q>How much come ad Japan?</q></p>
               <p><q>The same</q>.</p>
               <p>She sighed. <q>Sa-ay, kind augustness, I wan’ go ad America. Pray give me moneys
                     go there</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I’ll take you some day, Yuki</q>.</p>
               <p>She retreated before this offer.</p>
               <p><q>Ah, thangs—yes, some day, of course</q>. Then, after a mediative moment: <q>Sa–ay, it taking more
                     money than thad three-four hundred dollar whicheven?</q></p>
               <p><q>Yes; about that much again for incidentals—possibly more</q>.</p>
               <p>She sighed hugely this time, and he knew she was not affecting.</p>
               <p>A few days later, poking among her <pb n="80"/>pretty belongings, as he so much
                  liked to do—she was out in the garden gathering flowers for their dinner-table—he
                  found her little jewel-box. Like everything else she possessed, it was daintily
                  perfumed. At the top lay the few pieces of jewelry he had bought for her on
                  different occasions when he had taken her on trips to the city. He lifted the top
                  tray, and then he saw something that startled him. It was a roll of bank-bills. He
                  took it out and counted it. There was not quite one hundred dollars. He calculated
                  all he had given her. It amounted to a little over twice this sum. She had been
                  saving, after all! What was her object? </p>
               <p>And, his suspicions awakened by this discovery, he searched uneasily further
                  through her apartments, and discovered, rolled like a huge piece of carpet and
                  covered over by a large basket, the crêpe and silks she had protested were stolen. </p>

               <p>The second time his wife left him, Jack Bigelow was very wretched. He missed her
                  exceedingly, though he would not have admitted it, for he was also very angry with
                  her. </p>
               <p>When she had gone away that first time, so soon after their marriage, he had not
                  felt her absence as he did now, for then she had not become a necessity to him.
                  But she had lived with him now two whole months, and had become a part of his
                  life. She was not a mere passing fancy, and he knew it was folly to endeavor so to
                  convince himself, as in his resentment at her treatment he was trying to do.</p>
               <p>The house was desolate without her. <pb n="82"/>Everywhere there were evidences of
                  his little girl. Here a pair of her tiny sandals, some piece of tawdry <foreign
                     xml:lang="ja">kanzashi</foreign> for her hair, her <foreign xml:lang="ja"
                     >koto</foreign>, <foreign xml:lang="ja">samisen</foreign> and little drum; in
                  the <foreign xml:lang="ja">zashishi</foreign>, in her own little room, and all
                  over the house lingered the faint odor of her favorite perfume, so subtle that it
                  made the young man weak.</p>
               <p>He grew to hate the silence of the rooms. Their household had always been small,
                  with just a man and maid to wait on them; and now only one presence gone from it,
                  and yet how painfully quiet the place had grown! He realized what all her little
                  noises had become to him. He stayed outdoors as much as he could, only to return
                  restlessly to the house, with a faint hope that perhaps she was hiding somewhere
                  in it, and playing some prank on him, as she was fond of doing, bursting out from
                  some unexpected place of hiding. But there was no trace of her anywhere; and when
                  the <pb n="83"/>second day actually passed, the realization that she was indeed
                  gone forced itself home to him, leaving him stupid with rage and despair.</p>
               <p>He was bitterly angry with her. She had no right to leave him like this, without a
                  word of explanation. How was he to know where she had gone or what might happen to
                  her? And the thought of anything dire really overtaking her nearly drove him
                  distracted. He hung around the balconies of the house, wandered down into the
                  garden, and strayed restlessly about. And all the time he knew he was waiting for
                  her, and in the waiting doubling his own misery.</p>
               <p>She came back in four days, slipped into the house noiselessly and ran up to her
                  room. He heard her, knew she had returned, but checked his first impulse to go to
                  her, and threw himself back on a couch, where he assumed a careless attitude,
                  which he relentlessly changed to a stern, unapproachable, forbidding one.</p>
               <pb n="84"/>
               <p>Suddenly he heard her voice. It came floating down the stairs, every weird minor
                  note thrilling, mocking, fascinating him. <q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Toko-ton-yare
                        ron-ton-ton!</foreign></q> she sang. Then the voice ceased a moment. She was
                  waiting for him to call her. He did not move. He was certainly very angry with
                  her. He would not forgive her readily.</p>
               <p>She began beating on her drum. He heard her making a great noise in the little
                  room up-stairs, and understood her object. She was trying to attract him. Suddenly
                  she whirled down the stairs and burst in on him with a merry peal of laughter.</p>
               <p>He ignored her sternly. She ceased her noise and laughter, and, approaching him,
                  studied him with her head titled bewitchingly on one side.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>You angery ad me, excellency?</q> she inquired with solicitude.</p>
               <p>No reply.</p>
               <p><q>You very <emph>mad</emph> ad me, augustness?</q></p>
               <p>Still no reply.</p>
               <pb n="85"/>
               <p><q>You very <emph>cross</emph> ad me, my lord?</q></p>
               <p>Jack regarded her in contemptuous silence.</p>
               <p>She shouted now, a high, mocking, joyous note in her laughter. </p>
               <p><q>Hah! You very, very, very, very <emph>affended,</emph> Mister Bigelow?</q></p>
               <p><q>It seems to please you, apparently</q>, said Jack, scathingly, wasting his
                  sarcasm, and turning his eyes from her.</p>
               <p>She laughed wickedly. </p>
               <p><q>Ah, tha’s so nize</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What is?</q> he demanded, sharply.</p>
               <p><q>Thad you loog so angery. My! You loog lig grade big—whad you call
                     thad—toranadodo</q>. She knew how to pronounce <q>tornado</q>, but wanted to make him
                  laugh. She failed in her purpose, however. She tried another way.</p>
               <p><q><emph>How</emph> you change!</q> She sighed with beatific delight.</p>
               <p>Jack growled.</p>
               <p><q>Dear me! I thing you grown more nize-loogin</q>, she said.</p>
              <pb n="86"/>
               <p>Jack got up and walked across to the window, turning his back deliberately on her,
                  and whistling with forced gayety, his hands in his pockets. She approached him
                  with feigned timidity and stood at his elbow.</p>
               <p><q>You glad to see me bag, excellency?</q></p>
               <p><q>No!</q> shortly.</p>
               <p>This emphatic answer frightened her. She was not so sure of herself, after
                  all.</p>
               <p><q>You wan’ me go ’way?</q> she asked, in the smallest voice.</p>
               <p><q>Yes</q>.</p>
               <p>She loitered only a moment, and then <q>Ah-bah</q> (good-bye) she said softly.</p>
               
             
               
               <p>He felt, for he would not turn around to see, that she was crossing the room
                  slowly, reluctantly. He heard the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> pushed
                  aside and then shut to. He was alone! He sprang forward and called her name aloud.
                  She came running back to him and plunged into his arms. He held her close, almost
                     <pb n="87"/> fiercely. The anger was all gone. His face was white and drawn.
                  The dread of losing her again had overpowered him. When she tried to extricate
                  herself from his arms he would not let her go. He sat down on one of the chairs,
                  and held her on his knee. She was laughing now, laughing and pouting at his white
                  face.</p>
               <p><q>My crashes!</q> she said. <q>you loog lige ole Chinese priest ad the
                  temple</q>. She pulled a long face, and drew her pretty eyes up high with her
                  finger tips; then she chanted some solemn words, mocking mirthfully her ancestors’
                  religion.</p>
               <p>But her husband was grave. He had not the heart to find mirth even in her
                  naughtiness.</p>
               <p><q>Yuki</q>, he said, <q>you must be serious for a moment and listen to me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I listenin’, Mr. Solemn-Angery-Patch!</q> She meant <q>Cross-patch</q>. <q>You loog

               <p><q>Oh, jus’ liddle bid visit</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Where did you go?</q> he repeated, insistently.</p>
               <p><q>Sa-ay, I forgitting</q>. </p>
               <p><q>Answer me</q>.</p>
               <p>She pretended to think, and then suddenly to remember, sighing hypocritically the
                  while.</p>
               <p><q>I lige forgitting</q>, she said.</p>
               <p><q>Forgetting what?</q></p>
               <p><q>Where I been</q>.</p>

               <p><q>No!</q> he said, shortly, stung by her falsity.</p>
               <p><q>I don’ sing so!</q></p>
               <p><q>Where were you, Yuki?</q></p>

               <p><q>You say you don’ miss</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I lied</q>, he said, bitterly. <q>Where were you?</q></p>

               <p><q>I thought you said you were visiting your people?</q></p>
               <p>She was not at all abashed.</p>
               <p><q>Sa-ay, firs’ you saying you miss me; then thad you lie. Sa-ay, you big lie, I

               <p><q>Yuki, listen to me. If you leave me like this again, you need never come back.
                     Do you understand?</q></p>
               <p><q>Never?</q></p>
               <p><q>I mean that!</q></p>
               <p><q>What you goin’ do? Git you nudder wife?</q></p>
               <p>He pushed her from him in savage disgust. She laughed with infinite relish. </p>
               <p>He sat down a little distance from her, and put his face wearily between his
                  hands. Yuki regarded him a moment, <pb n="90"/>and then she silently went to him, pulled his
                  hands down and kissed his lips.</p>
               <p><q>I have missed you terribly</q>, he said, hoarsely. </p>
               <p>She was all compunction.</p>
               <p><q>I very sawry. I din know thad you caring very much for poor liddle me, an

               <p><q>Why did you come, then?</q> he said, gently.</p>
               <p><q>I coon’ help myself</q>, she said, forlornly. <q>My feet aching run bag ad you, my eyes ill to see you, my hands gone mad to touch you</q></p>
               <p>She had grown in a moment serious, but also melancholy. </p>
               <p>After a pause she said, more brightly, <q>I bringin’ you something—something so
                     nize, dear my lord</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What is it, Yuki, dear?</q> He was reluctant to let her go even for a
                  moment.</p>
               <p><q>Flowers</q>, she said—<q>summer flowers</q></p>
               <pb n="91"/>
               <p>He released her, and she brought them to him, a huge bunch of azaleas. She buried
                  her delightful little nose in them. <q>Ah</q>, she said, <q>flowers mos’ sweetes’
                     thing in all the worl’, an’ all them same flowers for you, for you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Where did you get them, dear?</q> he asked, taking her hands instead of the
                  flowers, and drawing her, flowers and all, into his arms. She faltered a little,
                  and then said, with the old darng smile flashing back in her face: <q>Nize
                     Japanese gents making me present those flowers</q>.</p>
               <p>He caught her wrists in a grip of iron. <q>What do you mean?</q> he demanded, fiercely, wild jealousy assailing him.</p>
               <p>She pulled herself from him, and regarded the little wrists ruefully.</p>
               <p><q>Ain’ you shamed?</q> she accused.</p>
               <p><q>Yes!</q> He kissed the little wrists with an inward sob. <q>Tell me all, my
                     little one. Please do not hide anything from me! I can’t bear it!</q></p>
               <pb n="92"/>
               <p><q>Thad Japanese gent wanter marry with me</q>, she informed him, calmly smiling,
                  and dimpling as if it amused her, and then making a face to show him her feelings
                  in the matter. </p>
               <p><q>My! How he <emph>adore</emph> me!</q> she added, vividly.</p>
               <p><q>Marry with you! What do you mean? You are my wife!</q></p>
               <p><q>Yes, bud <emph>he</emph> din know thad</q>, she said, consolingly; <q>an’ see,
                     I bringing his same flowers unto you</q>.</p>
               <p>He took them from her arms. They were all crushed now, and it distressed her. No
                  Japanese can bear to see a flower abused. She fingered some of the petals sadly;
                  then she sighed, looking up at him with tears in her eyes. </p>
               <p><q>Tha’s mos’ beautiful thing’ in all the whole worl’</q>, she said, indicating
                  the flowers—<q>so pure, so kind, so sweet</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I know something more beautiful and sweet, and––and pure</q>.</p>
               <pb n="93"/>
               <p><q>Ah, whad?</q> she said, her face shining, the pupils of the blue eyes so large as to make them look almost black.</p>
               <p><q>My wife!</q> he breathed.</p>

               <p>Every day, all unknown to Yuki, her husband looked into her little jewel-box. The
                  pile of bills grew larger. He no longer refused her requests for money. The fund
                  was quite large now. The last time he had counted it there were four hundred
                  dollars. He took a whim to make it five hundred, and that same day gave her a
                  clear hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>She had given him a solemn promise never to leave him again without his knowledge
                  and consent, and for a whole month she had kept steadfastly at home. It was the
                  happiest month in his life, a month that spelled naught else but joy and sunshine. </p>
             <pb n="95"/>
               <p>But the day after he had given her the hundred dollars she came to him and begged
                  very humbly to be permitted to visit her old father and mother and seventeen
                  little brothers and sisters. She still kept up this deception. He refused her
                  almost gruffly. He had grown selfish and spoiled under her care. All that day,
                  however, he watched her suspiciously, fearful lest she should slip away. And he
                  was right. In the evening, when she had left him for a moment, he saw her leaving
                  the house. He took his hat, and, keeping at a good distance from her, but never
                  losing sight of her for a moment, he followed her.</p>
               <p>Twilight was falling. Softly, tenderly, the darkness swept away the exquisite rays
                  of red and yellow that the departing sun had left behind, for it was crossing the
                  waters, until, far in the distance, it dipped deep down as though swallowed up by
                  the bay. </p>
               <p>Yuki was walking rapidly towards <pb n="96"/>Tokyo. It was only a short distance,
                  but nevertheless the thought of her little tender feet treading it alone, and at
                  such an hour, unnerved her husband. Whatever her mission, wherever she was going,
                  he would follow her. She belonged to him completely. She should never escape him
                  now, he told himself.</p>
               <p>She seemed to know her way, and showed no hesitation or fear when once in Tokyo,
                  but bent her steps quickly and with assurance, until finally they were before the
                  great terminal station at Shimbashi. They had come a long distance. The girl
                  looked tired; weary shadows were under her eyes, as she passed into the railway
                  enclosure and bought a ticket for a town suburb a short distance from Tokyo.</p>
               <p>Her husband went to the window, inquired where the girl was going, and bought a
                  ticket for the same place. </p>
               <p>Then began the journey in the uncomfortable train, where there were no sleeping
                  accommodatiosn whatever. <pb n="97"/>Yuki found a seat, and sat very quietly
                  staring out at the flying darkness. After a time she put her head back against the
                  seat, and, despite the jolting of the train, fell asleep. </p>
               <p>Her husband was close to her now—in the next seat, in fact. He could have touched
                  her, as he so longed to do, but would not for fear of disturbing or frightening
                  her. </p>
               <p>When they reached the little town, the banging of the doors, the blowing of
                  whistles, and shouts of the conductors awakened her. She came to life with a
                  start, gathered her little belongings together, and left the train, her husband
                  still following her. </p>
               <p>It was a refined and beautiful little town they had arrived at, apparently the
                  home of the exclusive and cultivated Japanese. Its atmosphere was grateful and
                  pleasing after the crowded city of Tokyo, with its endless labyrinth of narrow
                  streets and grotesque sign-boards, and ceaseless noises. </p>
               <pb n="98"/>
               <p>Yuki had not far to walk. Only a few steps from the little station, and then she
                  was before one of those old-fashioned, pretentious palaces once affected by the
                  nobles. There were signs of neglect about the house and gardens, which had fallen
                  out of repair. No coolies or servants were in sight. At the garden gate she paused
                  a moment, leaning wearily against it, ere she opened and and passed through, up
                  the garden walk, and disappeared into the shadows of the palace. Her husband stood
                  for a long time staring blankly into the gloom. </p>
               <p>Her husband stood for a long time as though rooted to the spot. Then very slowly
                  he retraced his steps to the railway station, bought his ticket, and returned to
                  Tokyo. He felt sure she would come back to him.</p>
               
           
               
               <p>And she did, hardly two days later. He was very gentle to her this time. There
                  were no more questions asked, and she vouchsafed no explanation.</p>
               <p>But she came back to him strangely docile and submissive. All the old <pb n="99"
                  />mockery and folly had vanished. She was angelic in her sweet tenderness and
                  solicitude. But once he found her in tears. She protested they had come there
                  because she had laughed so hard. Another time, when he offered her money, she
                  refused passionately to accept it. It was the first time since she had lived with
                  him. Thereafter she refused to take even the regular weekly allowance agreed upon.
                  He looked in her little jewel-box, and found the money all gone.</p>
               <p>Her docility and gentleness strengthened his confidence in her. He was sure she
                  would never leave him again. He even told her of his belief, and she did not deny
                  it. But her eyes were tearful. With boyish insistence he teased her. </p>
               <p><q>Tell me so—that you will never leave me again</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Never?</q> she said, but the word slipped her lips as a question. </p>
               <p><q>Repeat it after me</q>, he demanded.</p>
               <pb n="100"/>
               <p><q>Say: ‘I—shall—never—never—leave you again’</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Ah, you makin’ fun ad me</q>, she protested, begging the question.</p>
               <p>But he still persisted, and made her repeat slowly after him, word by word, that
                  she would remain with him till death should part them.</p>
               <p>One day he found her laboriously occupied at her small writing-desk. Her little
                  hand new down the page, rapidly drawing the strange characters of her country’s
                  letters. </p>
               <p><q>What are you doing? You look as wise and solemn as a female Buddha</q>.</p>
               <p>Yuki carefully blotted and covered her letter. She did not answer him. Instead she
                  held up her little stained fingers, to show him the ink on them. He sat down
                  beside her, kissing the tips of her fingers.</p>
               <p><q>To whom were you writing, fairy- sage?</q> he said. </p>
               <p><q>To whom? My brudder</q>. </p>
               
               <pb n="101"/>
               <p><q>Your brother! Ah, you have a brother, have you? And where is he?</q> </p>
               <p>She still hesitated, and he watched her keenly. </p>
               <p><q>He live ad Japan</q>, she said, after a long moment. </p>
               <p><q>Japan is quite a big place</q>, remarked her husband, suggestively. <q>He has rather
                  large quarters for one fellow, don’t you think?</q> </p>
               <p><q>Japan liddle bit country</q>, she argued, trying to change the subject. <q>America,
                  perhaps, grade big place, big as half the whole worl’—</q> </p>
               <p><q>Not quite</q>, interposed her husband, smiling. </p>
               <p><q>Well, big’s one-quarter of the worl’, anyhow</q>, she declared. <q>Bud Japan! Mos’
                  liddle bit insignificant spot on all the beautiful maps</q>. </p>
               <p><q>What part of Japan does your family live in?</q> </p>
               <p><q>Liddle bit town two hundled miles north of Tokyo</q>.</p>
               <pb n="102"/>
               <p><q>Indeed</q>.</p>
               <p>She had spoken the truth, he knew. </p>
                  
                <p><q>Why doesn’t your brother come to see you?</q></p>
               <p> Now that he had commenced it, he stuck to his catechism doggedly.</p>
               <p><q>He don’ know where I live</q>, she said.</p>
               <p><q>Don’t know! That’s strange. Why doesn’t he?</q></p>
               <p><q>I ’fraid tellin’</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Afraid of what?</q></p>
               <p><q>Afraid he disowning me forever</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Why should he do that?</q></p>
               <p>He was getting interested. He disliked wringing her secrets from her in this
                  wise. He wanted her confidence unsolicited; but his curiosity had the betterofhim.
                  <q>Why should he disown you?</q> he repeated. </p>
               <p><q>Because I marrying—</q> she paused, somewhat piteously, holding one of his hands
                  closely between her own small ones, and entreatingly pressing it as though begging
                  him not to pursue his questions. </p>
              <pb n="103"/>
               <p><q>Well?</q> he said—<q>because you married—</q></p>
               <p><q>You</q>, she finished. </p>
               <p><q>Oh!</q> His ejaculation was rueful. Then he laughed, and squared his shoulders, and
                  shook his finger at her. </p>
               <p><q>What’s the matter with me? Am I not good enough?</q> </p>
               <p><q>Too honorably good</q>, she declared, humbly. </p>
               <p><q>Then why does your family object to receiving me into its bosom, eh?</q> </p>
               <p><q>Because you jus’ barbarian</q>, she said, apologetically, and then swiftly tried to
                  make amends. <q>Barbarian mos’ nize of all. Also <emph>I</emph> am liddle bit barbarian.
                  I god them same barbarous eyes an’ oogly hair—</q></p>
               <p><q>Loveliest hair in the world</q>, he said, stroking it fondly. <q>But never mind,
                  dearie. Don’t look so distressed. It’s not your fault, of course, that your people
                  disapprove of me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>They don’ dis’prove</q>, she inter-<pb n="104"/>rupted him, her distress deepening. <q>They don’ never seen you even</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But I thought you said—</q></p>
               <p><q>I jus’ guess. Tha’s why I don’ tell thad brudder. Mebbe he dis’prove you when
                     he see you grade big barbarian. Tha’s bedder nod tell unto him</q>. </p>
               <p><q>But where does he think you are all the time?</q></p>
               <p><q>He?</q> She lost her head a moment. <q>Likewise</q>, she continued,<q>he also
                     travel from home. Perhaps he also marrying with beautiful barbarian leddy.
                     Tha’s whad I dunno</q>. </p>
               <p><q>I don’t quite understand</q>, said her husband. <q>But never mind. If you don’t like
                  the subject, and it’s plain you don’t, you sha’n’t be bothered with it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Thangs</q>, she said, gratefully. </p>
               <p>On another day, as she sat opening his American mail with her small paper-knife, a
                  picture of a young American girl fell from the envelope. Yuki picked it up, and
                  regarded it with dilated eyes and lips that quivered. It was the </p>
               <p/>
               
               <p>They were like two happy children in these days. They played together like
                  children, and laughed as joyously and willfully.</p>
               <p><q>I have conquered her––she is coming to care for me––that is it</q>, said the young man.</p>
               
             
               
               <p><q>Why are you so good to me, Yuki-san?</q> he asked her one day when she had sent the maid away and had waited on him at the table with her own hands.</p>
               <p><q>Jus’ for liddle while</q>, she answered, softly.</p>
               <p><q>Little while?</q> This little pin-prick punctured his happiness and startled him.</p>
               <p><q>What do you mean?</q> he demanded, sharply. She could not answer. She put her head down and sobbed of a sudden with pitiful abandon.</p>
               <p><q>Don’t you care for me, Yuki?</q> he asked.</p>
               <p>At this she threw her arms tightly about his neck and he felt hot tears against his cheeks.</p>
               <p><q>My lord, I––I lof you!</q> she cried.</p>
               <p><q>Then why do you talk about leaving me?</q></p>
               <p>She sobbed even more violently, but gave him no answer.</p>
               <p>After that day she was constantly melancholy till her depression communicated itself to him, and he began to suspect her of once more deceiving him. He spoke to her sharply and watched her constantly and suspiciously.</p>
               
             
               
               <p>And then one day he found her clothes neatly packed in a bundle, as though in preparation for a journey, and his wrath burst its bounds. The full sense of her deceit smote and staggered him. Previously she had never taken any of her wardrobe with her. He thought that now she intended leaving him forever. He went to her and upbraided her cruelly. She denied nothing. She did not even trouble to mock or laugh at him; nor did she weep. She was mute, that was all; and he, infuriated, said things which rankled in his conscience for years afterward.</p>
               <p> After this time a painful constraint and gloom settled between them. The girl grew white and thin and wistful, the man cynical and restless; and in the midst of their gloom came word from Taro Burton announcing that he had arrived in Tokyo. Laurin rushed off to meet him, telling Yuki he expected an old friend and would bring him home with him that evening.</p>
