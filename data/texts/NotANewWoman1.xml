            <p>I am not a <q>new woman</q>. I believe in girls working in offices and holding positions down town, but only where they stand up for the standard salary and are thus in fair competition with men, and, therefore, not ruining their prospects. I seldom have employed a girl who offers to work <q>cheap</q>. They are a curse to the trade both for men and women. The employer will tell the young man applicant, <q>I can get a girl to work for so and so</q>, and where a girl stands up for a proper salary (and she generally gets it just as easy as a small one) she is a better friend to the opposite sex. I realize that <q>necessity knows no law</q>, but I also know that no one can live on the salary paid to some women; therefore it would be just as well that they did not work at all, but spend the time looking for work more remunerative. For it is time wasted working for what does not afford a living. If she will put so much by each week she will not fear being out of work.</p>
