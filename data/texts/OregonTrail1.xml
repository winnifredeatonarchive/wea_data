              <view>An Indian Village.</view>
              <p>From out of the sky vaguely and hazily, swooping down over the village comes the emaciated and ghostly figure of FAMINE.</p>
              <p>The Village itself is revealed in a state of destitution and misery.</p>
              <p>Against the skyline appear four fiery columns of smoke, and at the same time is heard the arousing beat of Indian drums. This is the Indian summons to a counsel.</p> 
              <p>There is a stir in the village and the Indians are seen leaving their tents and wigwams. Like a swarm of shadows they plod and push dumbly along toward a hill slope.</p>
              <pb n="A-2"/>
              <fw type="pageNum">A-2</fw>
              <p>On the crest of the hill a young Indian chief stands silhouetted against the sky. His arms are extended, his face is passionate and exalted. Below him, on the slope of the hill, is the great congregation of silent Indians. The young chief addresses them.</p>
              <p>He tells them that unless the white men are driven from the Indian hunting grounds the Indian hunting grounds the Indian will not live throughout the coming winter. Already they are dying like flies from starvation and plague. No longer do the buffalo roam the plains and prairies. The deer have gone from the forests. The white men have slaughtered the natural food of the Indian for their fur and hides. Now a horde of white people have gathered at Independence and are preparing to invade the Oregon lands in overwhelming numbers. They are forerunners of the hosts of whites who seek to rob the Indian of the land of his forefathers. Unless they are driven back the Indians will starve to death or be forced out of his own lands. The time has come when the Indian must repel the advance of these white people. They must be prevented from crossing the Cascades.</p>
              <p>His words are greeted by savage cheers.</p>
              <p>Through the clamoring throngs a very old chief pushes his way to the fore until he comes alongside the young chief on the brow of the hill. He raises his hands to command silence.</p>

              </sp>
              
              <p>The old chief tries to raise his voice above the roar. The young chief places his arm about the old chief’s shoulders and commands silence - old age must be respected.</p>

                 <speaker>Old Chief</speaker>

               <view>A trail winding around the side of a precipitous canyon wall.</view>
               <p>Two riders are loping along. Their outfit consists of their horses, surefooted, swift and tough Indian ponies, and two pack mules, in charge of an Indian who plods along behind. The older of the two men is Ren Bullock. He is tall, long-legged, with hair the color of corn-shuck and a long lean body. His eyes are clear and his face tanned. He has a look of intelligence and honesty and is as strong as a young ox. He is a Missourian. His speech is slow and drawling. He hesitates before speaking as if weighing his words. He never hurries, yet, at the right moment, seems literally to spring like lightning into vivid action and life.</p> 
              <p>His companion is of a totally different type. A happy go lucky, light-hearted, carless, pleasure-loving and likeable young chap with a natural quality of refinement about him. He goes by the name of Thad Jones. The two men are close pals, and partners.</p>
               <p>As they ride along, Ren sitting loosely ahorse, and looking out silently before him and That whirling his lariat and whistling the night begins to fall softly around them. The wind sings in the pine tops and through the canyon walls. A silvery sunlight, a glow of fading red still lingers in the sky. Ren points vaguely. </p>

               <p>The shadows deepen about them. They top the brow of a hill and draw rein to look down across a great sweep of plain. There, in a wide valley below them, the flares of a score of campfires are seen.</p>

               <view>THE IMMIGRANT ENCAMPMENT</view>
               <p>This is a large field or plain on the outskirts of the town of Independence (now a part of Kansas City). Here a host of immigrants, hunters, trappers, voyageurs, traders, gamblers, adventurers, missionaries, teachers, farmers, as well as the rag tag and bobtail and outcasts of the frontier <pb n="B-4."/><fw type="pageNum">B-4.</fw> town have gathered from all parts of the country to keep a rendezvous at the starting off place for the Oregon trail.</p>
               <p>Vehicles of all manner and kind form an immense circle about a central point.</p>
               <p>The flares of campfires, stream up, flooding the place with a mellow light, illuminating the faces of these hardy adventurers and pioneers.</p>
               <p>In a way this scene should parallel the Indian scene in as much as the immigrants are addressed by their commander in chief Colonel Blair Appleton.</p>
               <p>The Colonel is a man of striking appearance, six feet four,  stalwart and strong in spite of his sixty-five years. His glance is keen and piercing from under beetling brows. His carriage is military yet his whole personality emanates a fine graciousness and cheer.</p>
               <p>He thanks the immigrants for electing his commander in chief. He tells them that they are about to set out into an unknown country - a country reputed to be a land of Milk and Honey. In glowing words he paints Oregon - the richness of its soil - the trees loaded with fruit - the streams abounding in fish; the forest alive with game; to say nothing of the fabulous possibilities from trade with the Indians; the pelts of beaver, of silver-fox, of mink, of ermine and other fur-bearing animals. He declaires //sic// Oregon to be the greatest agricultural country in the world needing only the courageous pioneers to break its soil and dig from its bowels its mineral wealth.</p>
               <pb n="B-5."/>
               <fw type="pageNum">B-5.</fw>
               <p>The camera pans around the circle of faces of the pioneers. Nearly every man and woman there is inspired by hope and the desire to reach the <q>Promised Land</q>. their commander’s words evoke the wildest enthusiasm and excitement and he is cheered to the echo.</p> 
               <p>We show Colonel Appleton’s own wagon. This is an especially fine covered wagon, practically a moving household.</p> 
               <p>Standing up on the back step of the wagon looking out over the heads of the engrossed crowd is the Colonel’s pretty daughter, Sally Lou. She is thrilled and excited and does not hesitate to join in the applause for her father.</p>
               <p>From behind Sally comes out of the wagon Mandy, an old black nurse and nanny. Nanny beams at the loudly clapping Sally Lou but her attention is distracted by a less pleasing object. From around the side of the wagon a tall black boy with a bullet head and rolling eyes comes slouching lazily to the fore, a bucket in his hand which spills and shakes as Mose moves along. Just as he comes under where Sally is standing Mose puts his thumb and fore-finger into his mouth and lets out a most unearthly whistle. Mandy casts one enraged glance at Mose and then reaching her left foot she gives him a hard prod on the head knocking him over and the pail of water spilling as he falls.</p>
               <milestone unit="line"/>
               <view>SALOON AND DANCE HALL</view>
               <p>This is the town of Independence.</p>
               <p>The atmosphere of the place is smoky and sultry. //B-6.// rough men of all sorts and kind are about the place gambling, making love to the girls, drinking and lining the bar.</p>
               <p>Here are dark French Canadian Voyageurs, long blonde Missourians, Mexicans, Swedes, Yanks, Jews, Englishmen, big fellows from the frontier towns.</p>               <p>Handsfull of silver are thrown or slapped down upon the bar. All comers are treated regardless.</p>
               <p>The fiddles scrape and the music rises above the discordant murmurs and imprecations. Buxom girls of all colors spin out upon the floor. They are grabbed by the men, whooping with delight, and they thumping or spinning with them across the floor. Near fights or real ones are precipitated and averted.</p>
               <p>One black eyed girl - she is known as Black Eyed Susan is the center of a group of men all clamoring to dance or drink with her. Sue has large, bold, roving eyes. Everyone is asking her where Bull is and she says he’s somewhere in town. One fellow says; <q>Well don’t tell on me</q>! He pinches her on the backside and gives her a good smack on the lips. Susan though she laughs gives him a push.</p>
               <p>The one subject of conversation everywhere is - OREGON. Everybody is talking of Oregon, and the immense train of Immigrants starting out for Oregon lands. Even the dancing girls talk Oregon to their partners. Some of them ask the men if they are going too, and when the men nod, //B-7// they pretend to bid them mock farewells, saying that the man who goes into Oregon never comes out. They make jokes about not liking baldheads, and the Indians always get their men. They think it funny to suggest that 2000 scalps will make a splendid carpet for Indian wigwams. They say that Immigrant scalps are especially soft. </p>
               <p>In one of the rooms of the saloon, Bull Doreen and his men are also discussing the Immigrants. Bull is a huge, brutal looking customer. He wears a red flannel shirt and buckskin breeches. His knife is stuck in his belt, his gun on his hip.</p>
               <p>Bull has done a profitable and illicit trade among the Indians, supposedly as a trapper; in reality as a vendor of corn whiskey and rum. The Indians have cached away immense quantities of valuable silver fox and beaver pelts. Bull is anxious to get up into the country to trade his booze for this fur, before the immigrants pour in. if once they settle upon the land; if in fact they reach the Williamette //sic Willamette// valley ahead of Bull’s outfit, his business will be ruined. Already too many immigrants have gone through. How this largest of all trains - 2000 strong - will spread over the Indian lands like locusts. It will mean the end of Bull’s trade with the Indians.</p>
               <milestone unit="line"/>
               <p>In the saloon, some commotion and stir is occasioned by the arrival of the two young scouts Ren and Thad. They are popular and well known, and their entrance is greeted with whoops. The young fellows goodnaturedly set up teh drinks for the crows.</p>
               <pb n="B-8."/><fw type="pageNum">B-8.</fw>
               <p>Bull and his men have also come into the saloon, and at a signal from Bull Susan speeds to his side. He gives her some orders, and she nods and hurries to obey him. Susan insinuates her way through the crowd till she manages to come alongside Thad and slips her hand through his arm. Thad has had a couple of drinks and is in high good humor. He looks down his shoulder and meets Susan’s black seductive eyes.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>

               </sp>
               <p>Ren, leaning against the bar, with a couple of girls interposing between him and his partner. Ren gives a wry squint across at the pair, and then as the bartender puts another drink before Thad, and as Thad picks it up, Ren reaches a long arm across and takes the glass from his hand. His action is good humored, but firm. There is a small protest.</p> 
               <sp>
                  <speaker>REN</speaker>
                  <p>Guess we better be driftin’ along //B-9.// partner. Them immigrants is waitin’ fer us.</p>
               </sp>
               
               <p>The girls and men make remarks:</p>
               <sp>
                  <p><q>Let ’em wait</q>.</p>
               </sp>

               </sp>
               <p>And so forth. Susan is hanging tight onto Thad, and her body is pressed against him. Thad’s glance shifts from his pal to Sue. he feels a bit sheepish.

               <p>Ren’s attention is turned from his pal, by Bull’s greeting.

               <p>Bull glares. Ren grins. His grin is not without a touch of boyish malice. Almost lazily and reluctantly he slouches a bit nearer to the black browed Bull. Bull’s glance goes by Ren. his eyes bore like gimlets into Susan’s. Hers reflect their momentary fear. 
               </p>
               <p>Thad, as his pal moves toward Bull, half starts to follow. The bartender has sets another glass before Susan. She lifts it first toward her own lips and then coaxingly toward his. Thad holds back a moment; but the liquor and Susan’s eyes are too much for the weak Thad. he swallows, licks and smacks his lips. Another glass slid across the bar. Thad glances at it wistfully out of the tail of his eye. Susan lifts it to his lips. He holds back a moment, and then, his eyes on Susan he downs it. Susan plucks at his sleeve. She puts her lips against his ear and whispers. Thad’s drousy //sic drowsy// eyes glean with awakening desire, for Susan’s body is pressed against his. He swallows, his head nodding. They move off.
               </p>
               <p>Ren does not see them go. Elbow on bar, his back against it, Ren’s wry glance is on Bull. bull shifts his tobacco, spits, waits for the smiling Ren to speak. Ren says not a word.

               <p>He moves away, strolling lazily along, good-naturedly pushing aside the girls that come around him, or pausing to joke, throwing a handful of silver on the bar and treating all hands except himself, and <q>drifting</q> off gradually till he comes to a door, giving upon an alley way and exits.
               </p>
               <p>Once outside, his careless lazy manner changes. He is alert, as he looks swiftly about him. With a hand to the side of his mouth he gives forth a peculiar whistle three times. At first there is no response. Ren whistles again. 
               </p>
               <p>From a room at the far end of the alley, where a dim light shows comes somewhat waveringly Thad’s answering whistle. Ren wheels about, and is off in the direction from which the whistle has come.

               <view>THE IMMIGRANT ENCAMPMENT</view>
               <p>The camp presents a cheerful appearance. Groups of cattle, horse and other stock are grazing on the prairie hardby, while the numerous white tents, the wagon covers and the flares and glow of the brightly burning campfires give almost the appearance of a village, or a homelike community. The music of the fiddle and guitar are heard, and around //B-15// the Colonel’s wagon, a number of young folks are gathered, some of them dancing a gay measure on the greensward.</p>
               <p>Sitting by the fires, on the steps of their wagons, on boxes, or camp stools, the older people look on indulgently.
               </p>
               <p>Gayest of all the young people and the most sought after is Sally Lou, laughing as she dances, and having her hands full keeping pace among the young blades of the party already contesting for her favor. 
               </p>
               <p>Over the brow of a hill, that lies between the encampment and the town of Independence, a party of horsemen are seen. They ride down toward the Immigrant camp, dismount outside the circle and come into the enclosure. They are Bull Dorien and a couple of his men. Bull inquires who is in charge of the expedition and is directed to Colonel Appleton. Bull’s manner is all affability as he holds out his hand to the Colonel and explains that he is a trader and trapper in the Oregon country; that he is returning there the following day and thought possibly he could be of some assistance to the train -- perhaps the Immigrants could use a couple of fine guides. Colonel Appleton thanks him but replies that they have already arranged to apply two well known scouts - Ren Bullock and Thad Jones. The two men have been highly recommended by the Hudsons //sic Hudson’s// Bay Company at Fort VanCouver //sic Vancouver// with whom the Colonel has been in correspondence and he has been informed that they know every inch of the country and are absolutely reliable. //B-16.//

               </sp>
               <p>               Bull pretends to hesitate and shakes his head as if worried.

</p>
               </sp>
               <p>This statement causes immense excitement among the Immigrants, who are crowding about the Colonel’s wagon. Sally runs up beside her father and takes his arm. Everyone around is talking at once, and the word soon spreads right and left through the camp that their guides are on a drunk. The Immigrants are opposed to trusting their fortunes to a couple of drunkards.</p> 
               <p>While the matter is being heatedly debated and argued, a curious little cavalcade rides into the encampment. Sitting straight and easy in the saddle is Ren Bullock. He is leading //B-17.// another horse across which is the dead drunk Thad, clumsily concealed by a great burlap spread. He brings his horse to a stop, puts back his wide hat and scratches his head as if puzzled. As he raises his voice the Immigrants turn and look toward him. Red rides right into the circle.</p> 
               <sp>
                  <speaker>REN</speaker>
                  <p>               Can any of you folks tell me who all is in charge here?
</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Colonel Appleton steps forward. He bows a bit stiffly. Ren looks down at him from his place on his horse, and then quite by chance his glance goes beyond the Colonel, and he sees Sally Lou. Sally is standing by her father’s side. She is watching the new arrival with tense interest. For a moment the two young people look at each other, and then with an embarrassed motion, Ren awkwardly removes his big hat and dismounts. He stands between the two horses, holding their heads by the reins. He has not heard a word of Colonel Appleton’s dignified explanation, to the effect that he has been elected commander in chief; that there are three divisions each with its individual captain, and that every man in the outfit has been assigned to some special duty. He pauses to ask Ren who he is and what he wants. Ren replies; <q>I’m your guide, sir</q>.</p> 
               <p>During the foregoing a certain inquiring spinster has been suspiciously looking at the burden on the other horse’s back. She has edged near to it, and has begun to lift the //B-18.// burlap, when her hand touches something and she emits a squeel //sic squeal// of terror. </p>

               </sp>
                
               <p>The spinster looks at him in suspicion. She edges over to the Colonel and says in a hollow whisper;</p>

                  <speaker>SPINSTER</speaker>
                  <p>               Colonel -- it’s a corpse!
</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Bull, who had kept in the background, gives the wink to one of his men. The latter is a skinny, foxy little one-eyed man named Lefty. Left [[sic Lefty]] slips over and pulls the burlap from the sprawled over figure, revealing Thad, lying face downward, his head dangling over one side of the horse, his legs on the other. There are screams from some of the women.</p>

               <p>The Immigrants by now are thoroughly opposed to being guided by such a disreputable pair. Colonel Appleton tells Ren that the deal is off. Ren is disposed to argue the matter. He and his pardner //sic partner// have come all the way from the Williamette //sic Willamette// Valley to take on the job. They are good guides -- none better in the country. What’s more the Immigrants will have a hard time finding guides who know the Oregon Trail. Col. Appleton tells him they have already engaged other men, and he indicates Lefty and Pete. Ren stares at the two men, and then his glance rests on Bull. A wry smile twists his features, </p>

               </sp> 
               <p>He throws his leg over his horse’s back, and moves off. He barely reached the side of the encampment when he is hailed by a curious looking man, who comes running after him. Ren pulls up, and looks down at the bespectacled little man, with rifle slung on his shoulder, and helmet on his head, a portfolio under his arm, and his pockets bulging with various articles. Ren’s face lights with a friendly grin.</p>

Ren has made the delightful discovery that the next wagon to Diggons is none other than the Appleton wagon, on the steps of which sits Sally Lou.
</p>
               <p>Ren stands perfectly still, smiling at Sally. Sally, forgetting herself, starts to return the smile and then her face becomes very cool as she tosses her head and looks over the head of Ren as if he were not there at all. </p><pb n="B-21."/><fw type="pageNum">B-21.</fw>

               <p>               The Immigrant train is now on its way. The long line of wagons, horses, mules, herds of cattle and other stock move like an army in review. Wide-horned oxen yoked eight to a wagon. These wagons moving households in which the family life is carried on.
</p>
               <p>               Hickory shirted teamsters roaring <q>Whoos</q> or cursing the oxen. Singing, shouting //n-word//; corn-crackers in homespun and high boots <q>gee-hawing</q> their mule teams. Teamsters, cracking eight foot bull whips and squirting yellow tobacco juice from bulging jaws; wagons milling in their dust. Some of the owners of the outfits driving in light springed wagons; other ahorse. Men plodding afoot at the side of each wagon. 
</p>
               <p>               Healthy children, rosy faces, peering from the wagons. 
</p>
               <p>               Buxom damsels in sunbonnets and cotton dresses on the front seats of the wagon, beside the driver, or driving themselves. Others riding horseback, with a youngster or two behind them.
</p>
               <p>               Some of the women knitting and sewing as the wagons move along. Others idly strumming on banjo or guitar.
</p>
               <p>In the rear of the caravan the droves of cattle and an endless army of mules.</p>
               <p>               Immediately following the guides, at the head of the long parade comes the fine covered wagon of the Commander in Chief, Col. Appleton. It is driven by the drowsy Mose, and //C-1.//sitting beside Mose is Sally Lou. Occasionally Sally Lou takes the reins in her own competent hands, and once she orders the sleepy Mose off the wagon, and the latter tags on afoot, yawning.
</p>
               <p>Riding alongside the Appleton wagon on a fine Kentucky horse is the Colonel. He looks very splendid and important and Sally is proud of her father. Occasionally the Colonel forgets his dignity, in so far as to ride to the tail of the wagon, from whence Mandy’s big black hand issues with some favorite edible or delicacy. The Colonel bites into a luscious doughnut or piece of Johnny cake. Then he clears his throat wipes the crumbs from his vest, straightens up in his saddle and looking very stern and serious, canterse down the line of wagons, on a military tour of inspection.</p>
               <p>The train is broken up into three companies, each in its way distinctive. The companies are divided from each other by the pack mules, but none the less they are within close touch of each other and then they go into camp all three companies are on hand. 
               </p>
               <p>The first of the companies and the largest is made up mainly of the farmers. The second includes the missionaries, teachers and others. The third is made up of a bold congregation of adventurers, gamblers, hunters, trappers and traders. Bull Dorien and a number of his men have cast their lot with this third company. Although each company has its individual captain they are all under the head of the expedition Commander //C-2.// in Chief, Col. Appleton.
               </p>
               <p>Travelling over a hill trail comes the little train in charge of Thad and Ren. the two young guides are on horseback, but Prof. Diggins sits on the front seat of the prairie schooner, and ever and anon almost gives the driver heart failure, as he leaps agilely out in search of some particular specimen in flora or to examine, on the edge of some sleep precipice, certain rock formations.
               </p>
               <p>Once the little professor gets out of the wagon and slides down a cliff to examine some bright specimens he had seen through his field glasses. He seems to have a charmed life, and by clinging to stumps and roots, actually returns with his portfolio of pressed flowers still under his arm and his hand clutching the specimens he went after. Ren and Thad who have dismounted, assist him to the top, but are in no mood to listen to his excited rhapsodies over his find. Ren picks up his field glasses. As he looks off across the skyline, great clouds of dust or sand seem to be arising. Ren puts the glasses to his eyes, and focuses them.

               <p>On the lower trail the Immigrant train is coming into sight. Ren watches intently, but his glass moves along the line till it picks out and stays turned on the first wagon of the train. Then he sighs and smiles.</p> <pb n="C-3"/><fw type="pageNum">C-3</fw>

                <p>               Ren hands the glasses to Thad. thad focuses them upon the first wagon. The girl in the driver’s seat turns her face so that he sees it clearly - she is Sally Lou Appleton. The glasses almost drop from Thad’s hands, his lips are quivering, his face has turned pale. Ren gives him a sharp look then he smiles.

               <p>               Twilight is falling. The western sky is like a sea of Mother of Pearl. The inescapable charm of the desert pervades the land.
</p>
               <p>The caravan of the Immigrants is seen rising and dipping along its course, men, wagons, horses, mules, cattle. Occasionally voices rise and can be heard over a vast distance because of the clearness of the air. Men speak to their horses; shout to each other. The crack of whips is heard. Someone whistles. There is the sound of the clear notes of a bugle, calling for a halt. The train has reached a suitable place for encampment. Now a movement that is almost military ensues. The train is wheeling into three circles, the leading wagons circling along individual tracks, till an almost perfect formation results. As each wagon is brought into position, with their tongues turned toward the center, the teams are unjoked. The cattle turnout out to graze. Horses are hobbled. The men fall to work making fires and setting up the rude tents for the night, while the teamsters and mule boys take care of their charges. The women, both in the wagons, and on the ground prepare the evening meal.</p> 
               <p>               Ren is disclosed riding toward the camp. He goes directly to the first wagon, dismounts and stands hesitatingly //C-5.// outside for a moment. As he hesitates, Sally Lou’s voice inside, calls out;

               <p>We show Mose. ahead of him, loping slowly and disconsolately along is Ren. Mose’s nostrils dilate. He slackens his pace. Mose lifts the chicken to his nose - sniffs. He begins to shower and shower. Now he licks his lips. His eyes shift and roll. He stops. He turns back a bit of the napkin, and succumbs to temptation. He takes first a nibble, and then a bigger bite. Finally she swallows the whole of the meal.</p>

               <view>               A series of dissolve shots should mark the passage and reveal the gradual deterioration of the Immigrant train.
</view>
               <milestone unit="line"/>
               <p>               In the beginning it was smooth going. The trail is excellent; the weather clear and fine. Hearts are light and hopes high. The train moves along like a great, well captained army. 
</p>
               <p>               Then begins the hazards.
</p>
               <p>First the almost daily loss of cattle and stock. This, we will bring out, is the work of Bull and his gang, but with the loss of their stock, and the mysterious destruction of harnesses and other equipment, a panic spreads throughout the companies. Arguments and dissensions arise; fostered by agents of Bull. Many are in favor of turning back. </p>
               <p>               The morale of the companies is weakened. Everyone looks to Col. Appleton for a solution. He has his hands full maintaining order and keeping the peace.
</p>
               <p>               Sally watches wistfully for the return of Ren Bullock. That little olive branch sent by Mose has not proven fruitful. Sally is hurt. 
</p>
               <p>               Ren, never having received Sally’s gift, (demolished by the hungry Mose) has struck out over the hill route.
</p>
               <p>               Meanwhile, as the Immigrant train proceeds more hazards and hardships were their lot. 
</p><pb n="D-2."/><fw type="pageNum">D-2.</fw>
               <p>               Mosquitoes and flies and gnats and ants swarmed in clouds about them. Rattles names //sic Rattlesnakes// and rats got into their wagons. Axels give way. Tops of poorly built wagons were blown off. 
</p>
               <p>               Cholera broke out in the camp, taking its heavy toll.
</p>
               <p>               After a vicious sandstorm, when for hours the cutting blasts of hot sand beat back the travellers, filling their nostrils, burning their eyes, with alkali dust, the morale of the train is so affected that a faction arises demanding that they give up the expedition and return. Delegations wait upon the Commander, and when Appleton refuses to accede to their demands, large groups of the Immigrants begin to desert in growing numbers, carrying away with them, not only their own stock and supplies but quite often the property belonging to the others. 
</p>
               <p>               Miles over a desert country - no water. A long trek and at last a pool of water. Thirstily the Immigrants dip their cups into the water only to find it alive with squirming tadpoles.

            <p>            Three hundred Indians beating their drums, singing and shouting and circling in a savage war dance. Their dresses simulate wild buffalo and wolves. Their padding feet seem to become louder with every step. As they circle, their women and old men and children, squatting on the ground, wail and screech.
</p>
            <milestone unit="line"/>
            <p>            Suddenly from over the hill resound other wild war whoops. A crowd of horsemen appear and ride full speed toward the circling Indians. Another tribe has come to join. As they ride, each warrior sings his war song. They are in war regalic, antelope skins and eagle feathers, and around their tunics they carry the scalps of the enemies. On their backs are bows and arrows, and some carry long lances. Their advent is greeted with savage zeal and joy. They join the circling warriors, themselves forming an outer circle on horse.

            <p>Here we find encamped, Ren and his outfit. It is midday, and their horses are saddled; their mules yoked to the wagon, yet they are not moving. The delay is caused by the absence of Diggins who has wandered off, in his usual way. Ren is a bit uneasy, and sends his Indian off to look for Diggins. </p>
         <p>            There will be dialogue here between Ren and Thad bringing out that they are now in Indian territory, and have been about three months on the trail. The train had left in mid-July. It is now mid-September. Re,, a thorough woodsman, and knowing the country well, has taken excellent care of his outfit. They show no signs of hardship. Thad is bored.
</p>

            <view>            We cut to another part of the woods, and show the wandering Diggins. Magnifying glass in hand he is absorbedly peering through it at some specimen.
</view>
         <p>            Watching him from behind the interlacing shrubbery is and Indian. He drops on his knees, crawls a few paces on the ground, kneels up, takes his quiver and bow and aims.
</p>
         <milestone unit="line"/>
            <p>            The arrow comes in and barely grazes the cheek of the abstracted and absorbed Diggins. The latter merely blinks makes an absent motion with his hand and continues to examine //F-2.// specimen.
</p>
         <p>            The Indian in the woods has been joined by others -- five of them. They are creeping silently and stealthily toward the unconscious Diggins. Now they are on their feet, in a semicircle behind him. One of them brings his two hands down on Diggins shoulders, and the latter is swung around. One of the knocks the helmet off Diggins head which is revealed as practically bald, save for a tuft of hair in front. Startled, but not terrified, the little scientist looks up at the Indians, and then guilelessly smiles. The Indians are puzzled. Diggins makes a confident, friendly motion, and says he’ll show them something very remarkable. He holds the magnifying glass over an ant.  It becomes enormously enlarged under the glass. The Indians are astonished. They look under the glass - start to touch it and then draw back, afraid. Diggins, pleased with their interest, shows them his other treasures - the portfolio of pressed flowers; the microscope, etc. The Indians are really amazed. They look at Diggins with respect. Undoubtedly he is a magic man and these are his talismans and charms. Diggins traps the heat from the sun with his magnifying glass and burns the hand of first one then another Indian. The Indians are divided between fleeing or taking the magic man. Diggins decides for them. He is extremely interested in the Indians and has set his glasses more firmly on his nose to study them. Making signs to them, he suggests that he //F-3.// would like to accompany them. One of the Indians speaks English and interprets. The others nod vigorously. They are now very friendly. The leader takes off his moccasins. Diggins asks what this means, and the interpreter replies: 
</p>
         <sp>
            <speaker>INTERPRETER</speaker>
            <p>It is the peace sign of our tribe, and means; <q>May I forever go barefoot, if I deal not truly by thee</q>.</p>
         </sp>
         <p>            So pleased is Diggins to hear this, and anxious to study the Indians at close quarters in their own village and wigwams, that he takes out a real treasure, in the shape of a gold watch. This he dangles by the chain before the chief, holds it to his ear and presents it to him. Then stooping he takes off his own shoes. The Indians raise their hands, circle him in a dance of peace. 
</p>
            <p>            During the foregoing, Ren’s Indian is seen watching from behind a screen of bushes.

</view>
               <p>               It discloses the Immigrant encampment at the base of a great canyon wall. Of the 2000 souls that had left Independence, but two hundred remain. 
</p>
               <p>The bugle summons everyone to the morning council. Col. Appleton, calls the roll of his people. There is a brief summing up of the resources of the train, and then the old Colonel breaks some painful news. During the night, their two guides have deserted the train, taking with them the best of the mules and raiding the supply wagons. </p>
               <p>               This is the crowning blow. Their supplies are depleted, their best mules gone; they have no guides to lead them. It is characteristic of these hardy pioneers however that after the first consternation and shock, they swiftly rally, and in a short time, men are picked for a posse to go out in search of the renegade guides and carry out without mercy the punishment decreed by the crude little court. 
</p>
               <p>               Riding through a thickly wooded mountain trail, Ren stops suddenly, as he sees coming up over the circuitous canyon route the two guides, Lefty and Pete. They are driving a number of mules and are riding Appleton’s Kentucky horses. Ren dismounts. From behind a giant rock, thickly overgrown with brush, Ren watches the men as they come up around the circling trail, passing one by one over the peak //G-2.// of the foothill. For a moment Ren, puzzled, and at the same time having his suspicions aroused, pauses, and then he follows. 
</p>
               <p>               When the last mule goes over the crest and dips down to the other side, Ren realizes that he is taking a chance if he follows, as he will be clearly seen from below. So he takes a perilous trail around the edge of the cliff that comes out presently into the same canyon for which the guides are making. 
</p>
               <p>               He sees, then, camped in a glen halfway down the mountain, near the falls, the company of trappers and others who had left the Immigrant train with Bull Dorien. After watching the camp for a few moments, Ren remounts and rides back along the trail over which he had come. 
</p>
               <p>               Ren returns to his camp. He sees no sign of Thad. giving his customary whistle, he receives no reply. A survey of the wagon and the hobbled mules show, everything more or less shipshape, though one mule is missing. Again he sends out the three whistle signals that the two men are accustomed to give. No reply. Ren whistles again, and this time, there is an answering shout, but not of the sort he had expected. It sounds as if someone were hollering with hands to mouth. It is not an Indian call.

               <p>               While Ren looks about him puzzled the Immigrant Posse ride into sight and dismount. Ren hears their story, and his own face becomes as grim as theirs.
</p>
               <p>               It is now getting toward sundown. The men fo the posse are weary. Their horses are watered and turned out, hobbled to graze. Ren builds a fire, and soon has bacon and potatoes sizzling over it. The Immigrants eat ravenously. Ren learns that for days the entire train has been on rations.

               <view>BULL’S CAMP</view>
               <p>               The flares from the campfires light the circle of rough faces. It is about ten o’clock at night. 
</p>
               <p>               Sprawled on the ground, is Thad. he is half drunk and tossing dice with a number of men. Prominent in the circle about the fire are the two guides from the Immigrant train. They are talking to Bull, who grunts with approval. Occasionally the men guffaw and slap their sides. There are about a dozen or more men in the outfit - some of them from the original train, hunters, trappers, voyageurs and others, as well as Bull’s own run sellers. 
</p>
               <p>               Suddenly three whistles are heard from out the bush. Thad lifts his head and half unconsciously he replies to the whistles. Bull starts up;

               </sp>
               <p>               From outside the circles comes the answer from a quiet drawling voice, as Ren lazily strolls toward the fire.

               <p>               Thad has partly recovered from his fright, and his shaking hand reaches for the booze. Bull whirls around and sees the coolly smiling Ren.

               <p>               Ren has come up at the back of Thad and, as if by accident, his knee knocks the drink from Thad’s hand. The latter looks about him uneasily. Bull strides over till he is facing Ben.

               <p>               As if unaware of the menacing movement toward him, Ren turns around and his eyes sweep the circle. A sardonic smile breaks over his face, as his glance becomes fixed on the two guides.

                  <p>I reckon it wouldn’t be so good for some folks. Here tell the Immigrants are takin’ through ploughs and threshers instead of <emph>RUM</emph>.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>               Bull pulls off his hat and sends it sailing into the dark. He peels his buckskin shirt over his head and flings it to the ground. The group fall back, making a wide circle, their excited faces lighted by the camp fire flares.
</p>
               <p>               Ren, who out of the tail of his eye, has watched the action of the other, but has made no stir, suddenly takes a step forward and drives in with a right swing. Bull ducks back, tries to run in and catches Ren’s left with the side of his head. He falls a dozen feet away, but comes up spluttering and cursing, with blood trickling down the side of his face. He circles the other warily. Bull is bigger and a gorilla for strength, though Ren is half a head taller and strong as a young oz. He waits for Bull with knees and hands lifted. Bull spits curses, and calls him vile names challenging him to come on. Ren has a slight smile on his face - a cool, amused look, and his left eyebrow lifts quizzically. The infuriated Bull springs suddenly, driving with a lifted knee and hard left. Ren sidesteps and gives him a terrific jolt in the belly. The blow lands with a //G-7// great thud. Bull stops in his tracks, while Ren throws a long right at his mouth that splits it open. Bull sits down, spitting blood and nearly mad with rage.
</p>
               <p>               The crowd is yelling and roaring.
</p>
               <p>               From out of the darkness and shadows of the encircling woods, step teh Immigrants, their guns cocked. Involuntarily hands are up.
</p>
               <p>               Lefty and Pete are nearly petrified with terror. Pete makes a dive for freedom but finds an iron grip upon his neck, as he is jerked back. Lefty, shaking and stuttering tries to explain that they’d only come for a visit and to get some help for the train. The Immigrants say nothing. They are doing their work competently. While a couple of them round up the lost mules, hobbled hardby; place packs of supplies upon their backs, others keep their guns cocked on the company, while the group about the now screaming, squealing guides deliberately place nooses about their necks, and prepare to hand them then and there within sight of the camp. 
</p>
               <p>               A hunter hoarsely demands to know what the men have done, and Ren’s quiet, incisive voice answers for the Immigrants. They have committed the crime of crimes in that country. They had taken on the job of guiding two thousand people into the Oregon country. They have misled and finally deserted them. As a last act of cruelty, they //G-8.// have stolen the Immigrants mules and most of their chuck.
</p>
               <p>               The men are hanged in the presence of the entire camp. 
</p>
               <p>               The little company of Immigrants and Ren, with their mules and supplies, are leaving. Several of the hunters are returning with them. They prefer to cast their fate again with the Immigrant train rather than continue with Bull’s outfit. Ren is on his horse. He looks dead serious; almost sad, as he throws a last look at the now almost deserted camp. A figure comes staggering toward him. It is Thad.

               <p>He reaches down a long arm and helps Thad onto the saddle of one of the horses on which the late guides had ridden. The little cavalcade is off.</p>
