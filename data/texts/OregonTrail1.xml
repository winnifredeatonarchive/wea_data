                  <stage type="setting">An Indian Village.</stage>
                  <p>From out of the sky vaguely and hazily, swooping down over the village comes
                     the emaciated and ghostly figure of FAMINE.</p>
                  <stage type="setting">The Village itself is revealed in a state of destitution and
                     misery.</stage>
                  <view>Against the skyline appear four fiery columns of smoke, and at the same time
                     is heard <sound>the arousing beat of Indian drums.</sound> This is the Indian
                     summons to a counsel.</view>
                  <view>There is a stir in the village and the Indians are seen leaving their tents
                     and wigwams. Like a swarm of shadows they plod and push dumbly along toward a
                     hill slope.</view>
                  <pb n="A-2"/>
                  <fw type="pageNum">A-2</fw>
                  <view>On the crest of the hill a young Indian chief stands silhouetted against the
                     sky. His arms are extended, his face is passionate and exalted. Below him, on
                     the slope of the hill, is the great congregation of silent Indians. The young
                     chief addresses them.</view>
                  <p>He tells them that unless the white men are driven from the Indian hunting
                     grounds the Indian will not live throughout the coming winter. Already they are
                     dying like flies from starvation and plague. No longer do the buffalo roam the
                     plains and prairies. The deer have gone from the forests. The white men have
                     slaughtered the natural food of the Indian for their fur and hides. Now a horde
                     of white people have gathered at Independence and are preparing to invade the
                     Oregon lands in overwhelming numbers. They are forerunners of the hosts of
                     whites who seek to rob the Indian of the land of his forefathers. Unless they
                     are driven back the Indians will starve to death or be forced out of his own
                     lands. The time has come when the Indian must repel the advance of these white
                     people. They must be prevented from crossing the Cascades.</p>
                  <sound>His words are greeted by savage cheers.</sound>
                  <view>Through the clamoring throngs a very old chief pushes his way to the fore
                     until he comes alongside the young chief on the brow of the hill. He raises his
                     hands to command silence.</view>

                  </sp>

                  <view>The old chief tries to raise his voice above the roar. The young chief
                     places his arm about the old chiefâ€™s shoulders and commands silence - old age
                     must be respected.</view>

                  <stage type="modifier">Two riders are loping along. Their outfit consists of their
                     horses, surefooted, swift and tough Indian ponies, and two pack mules, in
                     charge of an Indian who plods along behind. The older of the two men is Ren
                     Bullock. He is tall, long-legged, with hair the color of corn-shuck and a long
                     lean body. His eyes are clear and his face tanned. He has a look of
                     intelligence and honesty and is as strong as a young ox. He is a Missourian.
                     His speech is slow and drawling. He hesitates before speaking as if weighing
                     his words. He never hurries, yet, at the right moment, seems literally to
                     spring like lightning into vivid action and life.</stage>
                  <stage type="modifier">His companion is of a totally different type. A happy go
                     lucky, light-hearted, careless, pleasure-loving and likeable young chap with a
                     natural quality of refinement about him. He goes by the name of Thad Jones. The
                     two men are close pals, and partners.</stage>

                     before him and Thad whirling his lariat and whistling the night begins to fall
                     softly around them. The wind sings in the pine tops and through the canyon
                     walls. A silvery sunlight, a glow of fading red still lingers in the sky. Ren
                     points vaguely. </view>

                  <p>The one subject of conversation everywhere is - OREGON. Everybody is talking of

                     liking baldheads, and the Indians always get their men. They think it funny to
                     suggest that 2000 scalps will make a splendid carpet for Indian wigwams. They
                     say that Immigrant scalps are especially soft. </p>
                  <view>In one of the rooms of the saloon, Bull Doreen and his men are also
                     discussing the Immigrants. Bull is a huge, brutal looking customer. He wears a

                     gun on his hip.</view>
                  <p>Bull has done a profitable and illicit trade among the Indians, supposedly as a
                     trapper; in reality as a vendor of corn whiskey and rum. The Indians have
                     cached away immense quantities of valuable silver fox and beaver pelts. Bull is
                     anxious to get up into the country to trade his booze for this fur, before the
                     immigrants pour in. If once they settle upon the land; if in fact they reach

                  <view>Over the brow of a hill, that lies between the encampment and the town of
                     Independence, a party of horsemen are seen. They ride down toward the Immigrant
                     camp, dismount outside the circle and come into the enclosure. They are Bull
                     Dorien and a couple of his men. Bull inquires who is in charge of the
                     expedition and is directed to Colonel Appleton. Bullâ€™s manner is all affability
                     as he holds out his hand to the Colonel and explains that he is a trader and
                     trapper in the Oregon country; that he is returning there the following day and
                     thought possibly he could be of some assistance to the train -- perhaps the
                     Immigrants could use a couple of fine guides. Colonel Appleton thanks him but
                     replies that they have already arranged to apply two well known scouts - Ren
                     Bullock and Thad Jones. The two men have been highly recommended by the <choice>

                  <view>This statement causes immense excitement among the Immigrants, who are
                     crowding about the Colonelâ€™s wagon. Sally runs up beside her father and takes
                     his arm. Everyone around is talking at once, and the word soon spreads right
                     and left through the camp that their guides are on a drunk. The Immigrants are
                     opposed to trusting their fortunes to a couple of drunkards.</view>
                  <view>While the matter is being heatedly debated and argued, a curious little
                     cavalcade rides into the encampment. Sitting straight and easy in the saddle is

                     horse across which is the dead drunk Thad, clumsily concealed by a great burlap
                     spread. He brings his horse to a stop, puts back his wide hat and scratches his
                     head as if puzzled. As he raises his voice the Immigrants turn and look toward
                     him. Red rides right into the circle.</view>

                     the Colonel, and he sees Sally Lou. Sally is standing by her fatherâ€™s side. She
                     is watching the new arrival with tense interest. For a moment the two young
                     people look at each other, and then with an embarrassed motion, Ren awkwardly
                     removes his big hat and dismounts. He stands between the two horses, holding
                     their heads by the reins. He has not heard a word of Colonel Appletonâ€™s
                     dignified explanation, to the effect that he has been elected commander in
                     chief; that there are three divisions each with its individual captain, and
                     that every man in the outfit has been assigned to some special duty. He pauses
                     to ask Ren who he is and what he wants. Ren replies; <q>Iâ€™m your guide,

                     on afoot, yawning. </view>
                  <view>Riding alongside the Appleton wagon on a fine Kentucky horse is the Colonel.
                     He looks very splendid and important and Sally is proud of her father.
                     Occasionally the Colonel forgets his dignity, in so far as to ride to the tail
                     of the wagon, from whence Mandyâ€™s big black hand issues with some favorite
                     edible or delicacy. The Colonel bites into a luscious doughnut or piece of
                     Johnny cake. Then he clears his throat wipes the crumbs from his vest,
                     straightens up in his saddle and looking very stern and serious, canters down
                     the line of wagons, on a military tour of inspection.</view>
                  <p>The train is broken up into three companies, each in its way distinctive. The
                     companies are divided from each other by the pack mules, but none the less they
                     are within close touch of each other and <choice><sic>then</sic><corr>when</corr></choice> they go into camp all three

                     The second includes the missionaries, teachers and others. The third is made up
                     of a bold congregation of adventurers, gamblers, hunters, trappers and traders.
                     Bull Dorien and a number of his men have cast their lot with this third
                     company. Although each company has its individual captain they are all under

                     Ren. the two young guides are on horseback, but Prof. Diggins sits on the front
                     seat of the prairie schooner, and ever and anon almost gives the driver heart
                     failure, as he leaps agilely out in search of some particular specimen in flora

                     to have a charmed life, and by clinging to stumps and roots, actually returns
                     with his portfolio of pressed flowers still under his arm and his hand
                     clutching the specimens he went after. Ren and Thad who have dismounted, assist
                     him to the top, but are in no mood to listen to his excited rhapsodies over his
                     find. Ren picks up his field glasses. As he looks off across the skyline, great
                     clouds of dust or sand seem to be arising. Ren puts the glasses to his eyes,
                     and focuses them. </view>

                  <view>The caravan of the Immigrants is seen rising and dipping along its course,
                     men, wagons, horses, mules, cattle. <sound>Occasionally voices rise and can be
                        heard over a vast distance because of the clearness of the air. Men speak to

                        whistles. There is the sound of the clear notes of a bugle, calling for a

                     position, with their tongues turned toward the center, the teams are unjoked.
                     The cattle turnout out to graze. Horses are hobbled. The men fall to work
                     making fires and setting up the rude tents for the night, while the teamsters
                     and mule boys take care of their charges. The women, both in the wagons, and on

                     of Bull. Many are in favor of turning back. </p>

                     the Commander, and when Appleton refuses to accede to their demands, large

                     creeping silently and stealthily toward the unconscious Diggins. Now they are
                     on their feet, in a semicircle behind him. One of them brings his two hands

                     up at the Indians, and then guilelessly smiles. The Indians are puzzled.
                     Diggins makes a confident, friendly motion, and says heâ€™ll show them something
                     very remarkable. He holds the magnifying glass over an ant. It becomes
                     enormously enlarged under the glass. The Indians are astonished. They look
                     under the glass - start to touch it and then draw back, afraid. Diggins,
                     pleased with their interest, shows them his other treasures - the portfolio of
                     pressed flowers; the microscope, etc. The Indians are really amazed. They look
                     at Diggins with respect. Undoubtedly he is a magic man and these are his
                     talismans and charms. Diggins traps the heat from the sun with his magnifying
                     glass and burns the hand of first one then another Indian. The Indians are
                     divided between fleeing or taking the magic man. Diggins decides for them. He
                     is extremely interested in the Indians and has set his glasses more firmly on
                     his nose to study them. Making signs to them, he suggests that he <pb n="F-3."

                     very friendly. The leader takes off his moccasins. Diggins asks what this
                     means, and the interpreter replies: </view>

                     buckskin shirt over his head and flings it to the ground. The group fall back,
                     making a wide circle, their excited faces lighted by the camp fire flares. </view>
                  <view> Ren, who out of the tail of his eye, has watched the action of the other,
                     but has made no stir, suddenly takes a step forward and drives in with a right
                     swing. Bull ducks back, tries to run in and catches Renâ€™s left with the side of
                     his head. He falls a dozen feet away, but comes up spluttering and cursing,
                     with blood trickling down the side of his face. He circles the other warily.
                     Bull is bigger and a gorilla for strength, though Ren is half a head taller and
                     strong as a young ox. He waits for Bull with knees and hands lifted. Bull spits
                     curses, and calls him vile names challenging him to come on. Ren has a slight
                     smile on his face - a cool, amused look, and his left eyebrow lifts
                     quizzically. The infuriated Bull springs suddenly, driving with a lifted knee
                     and hard left. Ren sidesteps and gives him a terrific jolt in the belly. The

                     shaking and stuttering tries to explain that theyâ€™d only come for a visit and
                     to get some help for the train. The Immigrants say nothing. They are doing
                     their work competently. While a couple of them round up the lost mules, hobbled
                     hardby; place packs of supplies upon their backs, others keep their guns cocked
                     on the company, while the group about the now <sound>screaming,

                     people into the Oregon country. They have misled and finally deserted them. As

                     outfit. Ren is on his horse. He looks dead serious; almost sad, as he throws a
