              <view>An Indian Village.</view>
              <p>From out of the sky vaguely and hazily, swooping down over the village comes the emaciated and ghostly figure of FAMINE.</p>
              <p>The Village itself is revealed in a state of destitution and misery.</p>
              <p>Against the skyline appear four fiery columns of smoke, and at the same time is heard the arousing beat of Indian drums. This is the Indian summons to a counsel.</p> 
              <p>There is a stir in the village and the Indians are seen leaving their tents and wigwams. Like a swarm of shadows they plod and push dumbly along toward a hill slope.</p>
              <pb n="A-2"/>
              <fw type="pageNum">A-2</fw>
              <p>On the crest of the hill a young Indian chief stands silhouetted against the sky. His arms are extended, his face is passionate and exalted. Below him, on the slope of the hill, is the great congregation of silent Indians. The young chief addresses them.</p>
              <p>He tells them that unless the white men are driven from the Indian hunting grounds the Indian hunting grounds the Indian will not live throughout the coming winter. Already they are dying like flies from starvation and plague. No longer do the buffalo roam the plains and prairies. The deer have gone from the forests. The white men have slaughtered the natural food of the Indian for their fur and hides. Now a horde of white people have gathered at Independence and are preparing to invade the Oregon lands in overwhelming numbers. They are forerunners of the hosts of whites who seek to rob the Indian of the land of his forefathers. Unless they are driven back the Indians will starve to death or be forced out of his own lands. The time has come when the Indian must repel the advance of these white people. They must be prevented from crossing the Cascades.</p>
              <p>His words are greeted by savage cheers.</p>
              <p>Through the clamoring throngs a very old chief pushes his way to the fore until he comes alongside the young chief on the brow of the hill. He raises his hands to command silence.</p>

              </sp>
              
              <p>The old chief tries to raise his voice above the roar. The young chief places his arm about the old chief’s shoulders and commands silence - old age must be respected.</p>

                 <speaker>Old Chief</speaker>

               <view>A trail winding around the side of a precipitous canyon wall.</view>
               <p>Two riders are loping along. Their outfit consists of their horses, surefooted, swift and tough Indian ponies, and two pack mules, in charge of an Indian who plods along behind. The older of the two men is Ren Bullock. He is tall, long-legged, with hair the color of corn-shuck and a long lean body. His eyes are clear and his face tanned. He has a look of intelligence and honesty and is as strong as a young ox. He is a Missourian. His speech is slow and drawling. He hesitates before speaking as if weighing his words. He never hurries, yet, at the right moment, seems literally to spring like lightning into vivid action and life.</p> 
              <p>His companion is of a totally different type. A happy go lucky, light-hearted, carless, pleasure-loving and likeable young chap with a natural quality of refinement about him. He goes by the name of Thad Jones. The two men are close pals, and partners.</p>
               <p>As they ride along, Ren sitting loosely ahorse, and looking out silently before him and That whirling his lariat and whistling the night begins to fall softly around them. The wind sings in the pine tops and through the canyon walls. A silvery sunlight, a glow of fading red still lingers in the sky. Ren points vaguely. </p>

               <p>The shadows deepen about them. They top the brow of a hill and draw rein to look down across a great sweep of plain. There, in a wide valley below them, the flares of a score of campfires are seen.</p>

               <view>THE IMMIGRANT ENCAMPMENT</view>
               <p>This is a large field or plain on the outskirts of the town of Independence (now a part of Kansas City). Here a host of immigrants, hunters, trappers, voyageurs, traders, gamblers, adventurers, missionaries, teachers, farmers, as well as the rag tag and bobtail and outcasts of the frontier <pb n="B-4."/><fw type="pageNum">B-4.</fw> town have gathered from all parts of the country to keep a rendezvous at the starting off place for the Oregon trail.</p>
               <p>Vehicles of all manner and kind form an immense circle about a central point.</p>
               <p>The flares of campfires, stream up, flooding the place with a mellow light, illuminating the faces of these hardy adventurers and pioneers.</p>
               <p>In a way this scene should parallel the Indian scene in as much as the immigrants are addressed by their commander in chief Colonel Blair Appleton.</p>
               <p>The Colonel is a man of striking appearance, six feet four,  stalwart and strong in spite of his sixty-five years. His glance is keen and piercing from under beetling brows. His carriage is military yet his whole personality emanates a fine graciousness and cheer.</p>
               <p>He thanks the immigrants for electing his commander in chief. He tells them that they are about to set out into an unknown country - a country reputed to be a land of Milk and Honey. In glowing words he paints Oregon - the richness of its soil - the trees loaded with fruit - the streams abounding in fish; the forest alive with game; to say nothing of the fabulous possibilities from trade with the Indians; the pelts of beaver, of silver-fox, of mink, of ermine and other fur-bearing animals. He declaires //sic// Oregon to be the greatest agricultural country in the world needing only the courageous pioneers to break its soil and dig from its bowels its mineral wealth.</p>
               <pb n="B-5."/>
               <fw type="pageNum">B-5.</fw>
               <p>The camera pans around the circle of faces of the pioneers. Nearly every man and woman there is inspired by hope and the desire to reach the <q>Promised Land</q>. their commander’s words evoke the wildest enthusiasm and excitement and he is cheered to the echo.</p> 
               <p>We show Colonel Appleton’s own wagon. This is an especially fine covered wagon, practically a moving household.</p> 
               <p>Standing up on the back step of the wagon looking out over the heads of the engrossed crowd is the Colonel’s pretty daughter, Sally Lou. She is thrilled and excited and does not hesitate to join in the applause for her father.</p>
               <p>From behind Sally comes out of the wagon Mandy, an old black nurse and nanny. Nanny beams at the loudly clapping Sally Lou but her attention is distracted by a less pleasing object. From around the side of the wagon a tall black boy with a bullet head and rolling eyes comes slouching lazily to the fore, a bucket in his hand which spills and shakes as Mose moves along. Just as he comes under where Sally is standing Mose puts his thumb and fore-finger into his mouth and lets out a most unearthly whistle. Mandy casts one enraged glance at Mose and then reaching her left foot she gives him a hard prod on the head knocking him over and the pail of water spilling as he falls.</p>
               <milestone unit="line"/>
               <view>SALOON AND DANCE HALL</view>
               <p>This is the town of Independence.</p>
               <p>The atmosphere of the place is smoky and sultry. //B-6.// rough men of all sorts and kind are about the place gambling, making love to the girls, drinking and lining the bar.</p>
               <p>Here are dark French Canadian Voyageurs, long blonde Missourians, Mexicans, Swedes, Yanks, Jews, Englishmen, big fellows from the frontier towns.</p>               <p>Handsfull of silver are thrown or slapped down upon the bar. All comers are treated regardless.</p>
               <p>The fiddles scrape and the music rises above the discordant murmurs and imprecations. Buxom girls of all colors spin out upon the floor. They are grabbed by the men, whooping with delight, and they thumping or spinning with them across the floor. Near fights or real ones are precipitated and averted.</p>
               <p>One black eyed girl - she is known as Black Eyed Susan is the center of a group of men all clamoring to dance or drink with her. Sue has large, bold, roving eyes. Everyone is asking her where Bull is and she says he’s somewhere in town. One fellow says; <q>Well don’t tell on me</q>! He pinches her on the backside and gives her a good smack on the lips. Susan though she laughs gives him a push.</p>
               <p>The one subject of conversation everywhere is - OREGON. Everybody is talking of Oregon, and the immense train of Immigrants starting out for Oregon lands. Even the dancing girls talk Oregon to their partners. Some of them ask the men if they are going too, and when the men nod, //B-7// they pretend to bid them mock farewells, saying that the man who goes into Oregon never comes out. They make jokes about not liking baldheads, and the Indians always get their men. They think it funny to suggest that 2000 scalps will make a splendid carpet for Indian wigwams. They say that Immigrant scalps are especially soft. </p>
               <p>In one of the rooms of the saloon, Bull Doreen and his men are also discussing the Immigrants. Bull is a huge, brutal looking customer. He wears a red flannel shirt and buckskin breeches. His knife is stuck in his belt, his gun on his hip.</p>
               <p>Bull has done a profitable and illicit trade among the Indians, supposedly as a trapper; in reality as a vendor of corn whiskey and rum. The Indians have cached away immense quantities of valuable silver fox and beaver pelts. Bull is anxious to get up into the country to trade his booze for this fur, before the immigrants pour in. if once they settle upon the land; if in fact they reach the Williamette //sic Willamette// valley ahead of Bull’s outfit, his business will be ruined. Already too many immigrants have gone through. How this largest of all trains - 2000 strong - will spread over the Indian lands like locusts. It will mean the end of Bull’s trade with the Indians.</p>
               <milestone unit="line"/>
               <p>In the saloon, some commotion and stir is occasioned by the arrival of the two young scouts Ren and Thad. They are popular and well known, and their entrance is greeted with whoops. The young fellows goodnaturedly set up teh drinks for the crows.</p>
               <pb n="B-8."/><fw type="pageNum">B-8.</fw>
               <p>Bull and his men have also come into the saloon, and at a signal from Bull Susan speeds to his side. He gives her some orders, and she nods and hurries to obey him. Susan insinuates her way through the crowd till she manages to come alongside Thad and slips her hand through his arm. Thad has had a couple of drinks and is in high good humor. He looks down his shoulder and meets Susan’s black seductive eyes.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>SUSAN</speaker>
                  <p>‘Lo Thad! Gee, I’m sure glad to see you. Where you been?</p>

                  <p>Well, I got into a peck of trouble with good times.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Ren, leaning against the bar, with a couple of girls interposing between him and his partner. Ren gives a wry squint across at the pair, and then as the bartender puts another drink before Thad, and as Thad picks it up, Ren reaches a long arm across and takes the glass from his hand. His action is good humored, but firm. There is a small protest.</p> 
               <sp>
                  <speaker>REN</speaker>
                  <p>Guess we better be driftin’ along //B-9.// partner. Them immigrants is waitin’ fer us.</p>
               </sp>
               
               <p>The girls and men make remarks:</p>
               <sp>
                  <p><q>Let ’em wait</q>.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <p><q>What’s the hurry</q>?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <p><q>You’ll be a long time on the trail with those psalm singing folk. Wait a bit</q>!</p>
               </sp>
               <p>And so forth. Susan is hanging tight onto Thad, and her body is pressed against him. Thad’s glance shifts from his pal to Sue. he feels a bit sheepish.
