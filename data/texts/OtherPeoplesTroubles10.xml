               <p>Synopsis:—<q>Other People’s Troubles</q> is the new type of a continued story
                  wherein each episode is a complete story itself, but the whole is connected
                  through the central figure of Dr. Carpenter, a very fine character, who believes
                  that to get interested in other people’s troubles is the best cure for your own.
                  His niece, Laura, was jilted on her wedding day by a man who also ap­propriated
                  her brother’s invention. Felix Holt, a lawyer, accused of killing his wife’s
                  lover, but acquitted on trial, has consented to handle Laura’s court proceedings,
                  although since his own trouble he has lived the life of a recluse, and given up
                  his profession. The doctor’s last patient suffers from insomnia brought on by
                  <choice><sic>minsunderstanding</sic><corr>misunderstanding</corr></choice> of his wife’s interest in up-to-date women’s affairs.</p>

               <p><q>He! Dick!</q></p>
               <p><q>Well?</q></p>
               <p><q>I know he <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice></q>.</p>
               <p><q>Take my wager?</q></p>
               <p><q>Dick says I’ve a whole quart of sporting blood in me. He said that when I took
                     my first fish off the line all by myself. It was a darling little flounder too,
                     and I nearly cried because its mouth bled. But anyhow, just to prove it to you,
                     I will make a bet about it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Good. Now if Dick’s not either reading or has been reading certain books or
                     pamphlets or articles on woman’s suffrage, I’m to—er—well give you some sort of
                     a spunk pill to take before that speech of yours. But if he has on the other
                     hand, you are not to deliver it at all, but on the contrary are to gracefully
                     and like the little sport you say you are, accede to your husband’s wishes in
                     the matter, which I don’t doubt will be less harsh by and by</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Good!</q> exclaimed the little lady, smiling for the first time, and extending
                  her fingers to be shaken.</p>
               <p>With the frou-frou rustle of her pretty silk skirt, she swept out of the doctor’s
                  office, leaving a faint, delicious fragrance behind her that was as feminine as it
                  was sweet.</p>
               <p>The doctor sniffed it audibly, and then:</p>
               <p><q>It would be a great pity</q>, he rumin­ated to himself, <q>if she should
                     replace this with the sour stench of doped tobacco!</q></p>

               <p>The doctor had not seen his friend, Holt, for several days. So when the latter
                  turned up unexpectedly on a balmy night in June, he was received with two
                  outstretched hands of wel­come.</p>
               <p><q>Well, well! Here we are at last. Come right inside. Er-hum! Let me look at
                     you</q>.</p>
               <p>He had adjusted his glasses firmly, and was examining the other through, them
                  thoroughly. Apparently well pleased with his scrutiny, he released the glasses
                  from his nose, and spoke, punctuating his sentences with little movements of his
                  glasses.</p>
               <p><q>Holt, if I do say it, who shouldn’t, that medicine of mine is a winner, and no
                     mistake. You look ten—no fifteen years younger at least</q>.</p>
               <p><q>It’s a case of careful grooming, doctor</q>, said Holt, smiling gravely. <q>Did
                     I tell you, my man, Joe Manning is back with me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You ungrateful wretch!</q> snorted the doctor indignantly, <q>So you’re giving
                     the credit to Joe. Here pull up, your chair! Dash it all, I don’t believe
                     you’ve an atom of humor in your make-up</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I used to have</q>, said the lawyer, musingly.</p>
               <p><q>Stuff and nonsense! You haven’t lost a blessed thing you haven’t got to-day.
                     But here—look at this, will you?</q></p>
               <p>The doctor unrolled the wrappings from about a package which had been delivered
                  during the day, and spread out <choice><sic>oh</sic><corr>on</corr></choice> the table several new photo­graphs of Laura.</p>
               <p>Holt stared at them a moment in silence, and then, still without speaking, he
                  picked them up one by one, and looked long and gravely at the pictured face. He
                  appeared to be in some sort of reverie as he stared at the picture of his client;
                  but when the doctor spoke he started in his seat almost as if he had been
                  struck.</p>
               <p><q>I had these taken for the newspapers</q>, said the doctor carelessly.</p>
               <p><q>For the newspapers!</q> cried Holt. <q>What do you mean?</q></p>
               <p>The doctor regarded his friend in pretended astonishment.</p>
               <p><q>Well, it’s about time</q>, said he, <q>that this thing came out in the papers.
                  It’s bound to, sooner or later, and I insisted to Laura that she have new extra
                  good photographs taken, so she might look her best in the limelight of
                  publicity</q>.</p>
               <p><q>She consented?</q> asked Holt in­cisively. His eyes were fixed upon the
                  doctor’s face almost as if he could barely wait for the answer.</p>
               <p><q>Why, of course</q>, answered the doctor, in his most guileless tone. <q>Laura’s
                     nothing but a girl after all you know</q>.</p>
               <p>Holt threw the pictures down upon the table again. Then he got up and walked over
                  to the window.</p>
               <p><q>And by the way</q>, pursued the doctor naturally, as he piled up the
                  photographs in a neat little heap, <q>how’s the case proceeding?</q></p>
               <p>Holt turned about abruptly.</p>
               <p><q>It’s not going to proceed</q>, he said, between his teeth. <q>I—won’t go on
                     with it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, indeed? Did you ever begin it?</q> inquired the doctor mildly.</p>
               <p><q>No. It was impossible—from the first</q>.</p>
               <p>You <q>took the case</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You forced it upon me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Stuff and nonsense! When I told you the circumstances you were keen for
                  it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I changed my mind</q>.</p>
               <p><q>When?</q></p>
               <p><q>Well, from the first. I tell you it was impossible</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You mean—your returning to law practice?</q></p>
               <p><q>It was not that</q>.</p>
               <p>He looked at the doctor undecidedly a moment, and then suddenly strode across to
                  him.</p>
               <p><q>It was on her account, not mine</q>, he said.</p>
               <p><q>You mean—Laura’s?</q></p>
