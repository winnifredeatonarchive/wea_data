            <p>Synopsis—<q>Other People’s Troubles</q> is the new type of a continued story wherein
               each episode is a complete story itself, but the whole is connected through the
               central figure of Dr. Carpenter, a very fine character, who believes that to get
               interested in other people’s troubles is the best cure for your own. Dr. Carpenter
               has his niece, Laura, living with him, and also the servant, telling her of the great
               sorrow of Lenox Holt, a lawyer, who has been accused of killing his wife’s lover,
               and, although let free by the court, has the stigma of murder attached to his name To
               him the doctor is going to entrust Laura’s case. </p>

            <p><q>So he lives in an old house, just outside Fort Washington Park; and he avoids his
                  friends and shrinks away from that portion of the city where previously he had
                  been one of the leading lights. There are no servants even in the old Holt place,
                  just an ancient Irish pair who previously cared for the place as janitors, at the
                  time when Holt and his wife were part of the gay rushing life of Newport and
                  Manhattan. They don’t take very good care of the place. It looks dog-eared and
                  run-down, forsaken and neglected. You’d never suspect he was under forty, and a
                  man of means. For he looks more like a tramp. He roams about Fort Washington Park
                  and its environs, looking at the water and sometimes muttering to himself. He
                  fancies people point him out, and often he turns upon them like a savage and asks
                  them what they are staring at. And he wont go away, because he says it was here he
                  was born, and it was away from here he was betrayed. Friends who had not cut him,
                  he has cut, for when shame throws its black mantle upon us, it is then one’s
                  friends drop off like withered leaves, or cling greenly to the branches. And I
                  cling on to Lenox Holt, in spite of his oftentimes insulting cynicisms regarding
                  my profession and my aims. For Holt believes all men are knaves and all women
                  wantons and liars</q>.<note type="editorial" resp="pers:SC1">No closing quotation

            <p><q>Are you asleep, Laura?</q></p>
            <p>Her face was hidden against his knee. She looked up slowly, her dark eyes moist.</p>
            <p><q>No</q>, she said gently. <q>Oh, the poor man, the poor man!</q></p>
            <p>She was very silent for a long time after that; presently she stood up and, bending
               over, softly kissed the top of his head.</p>
            <p><q>Oh, Uncle Dan, dear, why is the world not all sad when there is so much trouble in
                  it?</q></p>
            <p><q>Because the world’s so sweet, my dear. It’s a recompense for the blacker things.
                  When the sordid, harrowing things of life press the hardest on us, there is still
                  always the sky and the stars left us to see—and be thankful for</q>.</p>

      <p>Dr. Carpenter picked up the telephone on his desk and grunted into the receiver.</p>
      <p><q>Er-hum! Yes, it’s Dr. Carpenter</q>.</p>
      <p><q>Where?</q></p>
      <p><q>Can’t you get——</q> </p>
      <p><q>But I want to go to bed. What’s that?</q> </p>
      <p><q>Er-hum! Very well</q>.</p>
      <p>He grunted again, and rang off.</p>
      <p><q>Oh, Uncle Dan dear</q>, said Laura, in a tone of gentle exasperation: <q>Have you got to go out
         again?</q></p>
      <p>She followed him into the hall and helped him slip into his great-coat.</p>
      <p><q>You were up all last night, dear</q>, she said plaintively.</p>
      <p><q>Yes</q>, admitted the doctor, and then clearing his throat with his cheery rough
         <q>Er-hum!</q>:</p>
      <p><q>But remember, Laura—there were twins last night—twins! It was worth it. It was worth
         it!</q></p>
      <p><q>I had hoped you could get to bed early to-night. Dear old dear! They’ll wear you out
         between them. Who is the call from this time?</q></p>
      <p><q>Barnato’s Theatre</q>.</p>
      <p><q>Little Bonnie Snow in some sort of trouble—conglomeration of sprained ankle and hysterics,
         I imply from the message. You remember Bonnie?</q></p>
      <p><q>Of course, though I haven’t seen her since I came to New York. Tell her, wont you, that
         I’m here with you now, Uncle Dan</q>.</p>
      <p><q>Er-hum! Now trot along to bed with you</q>.</p>
      <p>He raised her face, with his hand under her chin. Then he flicked a forefinger across the
         shadows under her eyes.</p>
      <p><q>To-morrow morning I expect to see these gone</q>, said he.</p>
      <p>She smiled sadly and shook her head a bit.</p>
      <p><q>I’m out of cold cream</q>, she said, whimsically, <q>and really, Uncle Dan, dear, I don’t want
         to get the regulation ‘massage face’</q>.</p>
      <p><q>Sleep is the best Masseur in the world!</q> growled the doctor, and closed his gloves with a
         snap upon each button. <q>You get. Into bed and blow your mind adrift, and whenever you find
         it fastening upon things that disturb you, pull it away with a firm grip, and fasten it at
         once upon other people’s troubles. I prescribe Lenox Holt’s for to-night. Think of him—of
         his tragedy to-night, as Mrs. Holmes has thought of Mrs. Finnerty, and——</q> </p>
      <p><q>Did you know</q>, she interrupted earnestly, <q>that she went to see Mrs. Finnerty, and she is
         giving her work of a lighter kind than washing, and——</q></p>
      <p><q>Did she say anything about her own—delusions?</q></p>
      <p><q>No, she didn’t. You see she was fixing her flat all up for the coming of her mother, and
         Mrs. Finnerty was helping her. I thought she looked quite well, for her</q>.</p>
      <p>The doctor chuckled, and pursed out his lips. Then he kissed his niece with a great deal of
         tenderness, and hurried</p>
