            <p>RE: <emph>Barbary Coast and Carnival</emph></p>

            <p>After reading the continuity of <q>BARBARY COAST</q> I am so depressed that I am
               going to beg you to have some other writer do the continuity for <q>CARNIVAL</q>.</p>
            <p>The original story of <q>BARBARY COAST</q> had flaws in it - it was real and the
               characters were vivid and natural. We had two good story minds as well as yours on
               this story and I refer to myself and <name ref="pers:CL2">Charley Logue</name>. In my
               opinion we had a novelty. Mr. Robertson and his assistant were enthusiastic about it.
               The story that has been substituted and wooden, the character are not real - they are
               tepid - emasculated imitations.</p>
            <p>I am awfully storry about this, I really feel sick about it but it seemed to be
               nothing short of movie vandalism.</p>
            <p>Our script had already been OK’d by you and it was a cinch for a continuity writer to
               work from. I don’t see what I can do in the way of doctoring up even the dialogue,
               the fact is, I feel as I don’t want my name on this. I tried last night to write
               dialogue on it, but it was no good. I just couldn’t do it.</p>
            <p>I hope you will forgive me for writing so bluntly I am an honest and downright sort
               of person and believe in putting my cards on the table.</p>
