         <div type="content">

            <p>I am going to take the liberty of asking for a bonus for my work on <q>Barbary
                  Coast</q>. At the time I signed my contract <name ref="pers:CL3">Junior
                  Laemmle</name> mentioned that he would give me a bonus on stories I worked on. As
               you know, I have worked steadily and skillfully and have delivered my scripts in
               record time. <q>Barbary Coast</q> moreover is an original story and it is unique. Mr.
               Robertson told me that he could shoot the picture right from my eighty-five page
               story with just breaking it up.</p>

            <p>I understand that I am receiving the lowest salary of any of the scenario writers
               here with one exception. I am not complaining especially so long as I am granted some
               sort of recognition and bonus when I write an original story or a treatment that is
               practically an original which was the case with <q>Ropes</q>, but I do feel that
               without this encouragement and incentive I could hardly feel the enthusiasm necessary
               when one is at work upon a story.</p>

            <p>I might point out the fact that <q>Shanghai Lady</q> is enjoying a big success now.
                  <name ref="pers:DA2">Del Andrews</name> told me that <q>Ropes</q> is even better
               and I am quite sure that both <q>Barbary Coast</q> and <q>Carnival</q> will top
               these.</p>

            <p>I am especially grateful to you for your kindness to me and I know that you are the
               one person in this industry who was able to bring out my capabilities. Under your
               guidance I <pb n="2"/> feel as if there is no limits to the work I can do. At the
               same time, I am not unmindful of the fact that the work I have done owed much of its
               inspiration to you. I know there was absolutely no changes or suggestions that you
               made that I did not try faithfully to follow and that did not immensely improve the
               work.</p>
