            <p>RE: -- <emph>CATTLE</emph></p>

            <p>In calling your attention to my novel, CATTLE, may I set down, for your information
               and reference, several matters in connection with the novel?</p>

            <list type="instructions" rendition="numbered">

               <item>It should not be considered in the class with the ordinary western picture. It
                  would make a Super-Western.</item>

               <item>There is no company so well outfitted to do a special story of this sort, as
                  Universal.</item>

               <item>The tremendous success of THE VIRGINIAN and IN OLD ARIZONA brings home the fact
                  that big western pictures are certain to go across with great success. Len Fields
                  has said that CATTLE would make an epic picture.</item>

               <item>The novel was published in 1924. No sooner was it out than nearly every motion
                  picture company negotiated with my agents in New York for the purchase of this
                  novel. At that time I was living on a ranch in Northwestern Canada. <name
                     ref="pers:HC1">Harry Carr</name>, then scenario editor for <name
                     ref="pers:DWG1">D. W. Griffith</name>, wrote me in Alberta and gave his opinion
                  that CATTLE was the greatest outdoor novel he had ever read. This he has repeated
                  several times in his column in The Los Angeles Times, <q>The Lancer</q>. <name
                     ref="pers:EC1">Elmer Clifton</name> was at that time associated with <name
                     ref="pers:DWG1">D. W. Griffith</name>. He made the trip to Alberta – a six <choice>
                     <sic>day’s</sic>
                     <corr>day</corr>
                  </choice> journey from New York – especially to see me and he bought the rights to
                  CATTLE. For years he held the property at a prohibitive figure, but I know now
                  that it could be bought at a reasonable price and at a very <choice>
                     <sic>nomenial</sic>
                     <corr>nominal</corr>
                  </choice> figure, in fact, if <name ref="pers:EC1">Clifton</name>, who is crazy
                  about it, were allowed to direct it or be associated in the production.</item>

               <item>The novel had a large sale and it is still issued each year. The London Times
                  referred to it as a Canadian <q>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</q>. It was reviewed
                  enthusiastically by such critics as Menken and <name ref="pers:CJF1">Charles J.
                     Finger</name>, who ordinarily do not notice current fiction. <name
                     ref="pers:CJF1">Mr. Finger</name> compared it with the work of Ruth Suchow and
                  the stories of the Russian Modernists.</item>

            </list>

            <p>We have in our files an excellent synopsis and you will note, from the comments of
               the reader, how strongly she recommended this story. I might say in passing, that I
               was not at the time in the employ of Universal, but was out in the northwest of
               Canada.</p>
