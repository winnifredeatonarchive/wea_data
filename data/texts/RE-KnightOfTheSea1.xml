            <p/>

            <p>You will recall that I spoke to you the other day about an old sea story which had
               been brought to my attention by a young lady in the Publicity department -- one of
               the writers there. She told me that <name ref="pers:JS2">Joseph Schildkraut</name>
               was very much interested in it and that it was concerned with <name ref="pers:JPJ1"
                  >John Paul Jones</name> and there was a background of the old sailing ships and
               the chantees of those times.</p>
            <p>You asked me to get hold of the manuscript and yesterday <name ref="pers:JS2"
                  >Schildkraut’s</name> manager brought it to my office. He made the remark that
                  <name ref="pers:JS2">Mr. Schildkraut</name> liked it very much.</p>
            <p>I read the story in part and I thought I would tell you that it is a very schoalrly
               and thoughtful piece of work on which I can see Mr. Smith has put a great deal fo
               time and probably enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>I know that the first opinion of a reader would be that it is too invovled, too
               historic, too episodic. Nevertheless if one cares to dig deeply enough into this work
               I think it is possible to discover a tremendous theme for a novelty super-picture. It
               is not written or constructed according to preconceived movie formula but the stuff
               is there <choice>
                  <sic>none the less</sic>
                  <corr>nonetheless</corr>
               </choice> though it makes tedious reading in the first part and we would need to
               contrive a better romance as far as the love story is concerned. Also we would need
               to do away with all the biographical, rather woodenly told, data. I can comprehend
               the sincerity with which this author set out to tell his story.</p>
            <p><name ref="pers:JPJ1">John Paul Jones</name> would make a great hero for a big
               picture. Every child in the United States and in every other country -- grown up
                  children<pb n="2"/><fw type="pageNum" place="center">-2-</fw> too, know of the
                  <name ref="pers:JPJ1"><q>Father of the American Navy</q></name> as he is called in
               history.</p>
            <p>I forgot to mention that there is the greatest sea fight described in this story that
               I’ve read.</p>
            <p>I believe the author has given us an authentic and vivid story of a great national
               hero. I don’t see why a picture of the American Revolution would not prove
               tremendously successful at this time and if tied up with a story with a salty flavor
               of the sea it might be something totally new. For that reason I recommend that we do
               not dismiss this story without further serious consideration.</p>
            <p>I’ve never met and do not know the writer of <q>KNIGHT OF THE SEA</q> but was told by
               the young lady whose name I don’t recall that he is a <choice>
                  <sic>navel</sic>
                  <corr>naval</corr>
               </choice> officer so I dare say he knows his subject well.</p>
