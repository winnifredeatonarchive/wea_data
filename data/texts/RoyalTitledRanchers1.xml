         <div>
            <p>Long before the Prince of Wales bought the E. P. Ranch at High River in Alberta, he
               had been preceded by other royalties and men and women of title, who had found this
                  <q>last of the big lands</q> an ideal place for ranching and adventure. The names
               of Alberta’s royal and titled ranchers read like pages from the Peerage.</p>
            <p>In the early days when Alberta was still in a raw and pioneer state, upon the heels
               of the missionaries and the C. P. R. came such men as Sir Francis McNaughton son of
               Lord McNaughton, who for thirty years ranched at Bow Ness, Alberta, and who still
               maintains a home in this country to which he pays an annual visit. A colony of French
               aristocrats was established at a place named Trochu, after the leader of the party. </p>
            <p>From one of the oldest and noblest families in France came to Alberta, with his wife
               and children, the Marquis de Roussy de Sales. They settled at High River, and are now
               residents of Montreal.</p>
            <p>Another French family which arrived in those early days, accompanied by a retinue of
               servants, was that of the Count and Countess de Foras, also of High River. They lost
               considerable money in their venture in the new land, but stuck pertinaciously at
               ranching, and although today there remains but a single one of the many servants that
               accompanied them from France, it is doubtful whether the de Foras could be induced to
               leave Alberta. They are working, practical ranchers. They have a large family of
               girls, noted for their beauty and exceptional talent. One of them, Countess Odette de
               Foras, won the scholarship of the Royal College and the Royal Academy of Music of
               London, England, and her phenomenal voice is now being trained for Grand Opera. Two
               of the sons put in the crop each year and then go out to work for the Telephone
               Company as mechanics and linemen. </p>
            <p>Lady Adela Cochrane was one of the first of the <q>Old Timers</q>. She established
               her ranch at what was then known as Mitford on the Bow River. Lord Norberry was her
               neatest neighbor. Bernard Howard, son of the Earl of Carlisle, ranched also in that
               part of the country. He made a great reputation as a polo player. Howard served with
               distinction in the recent war, was taken prisoner by the Germans, escaped and
               returned to England, and was soon again in action. </p>

            <head>A Problem For the Authorites</head>
        
          
           <p>Among the ranchers in Alberta in the early days was a son of the then Lord Decies. This member of the Beresford family married a girl of mixed blood. He was killed while riding on a freight train. His brother, Lord Charles Beresford, came out to Alberta soon after, but did not remain long.</p>
           
           <p>So many younger and—sometimes wayward sons—of the British nobility were shipped to this country in the years that followed that they became a problem for the authorities. Many of these had been sent out of the way because of trouble and mischief into which they had gotten at home. Some of them were hopeless dipsomaniacs. many of these succumbed to the altitude themselves. Others reacted to the spur of the new land and demonstrated that <q>blood will tell</q>. When the war broke out scares of these formerly wild young scions of Britain’s noble families poured down from all parts of the ranching country, and they made up a healthy majority of the men who marched from Alberta.</p>
            <p>The Mounted Police service also offered alluring prospects to the reckless
               youngsters. It has been said that there were more aristocrats in the mounted Police
               service in the early days than men from any other class. The life of adventure and of
               daring, the splendid code, the smart uniform, the association and romantic
               glamour—all this appealed to the newcomers. Among the men especially noted at that
               time was the son of Admiral Keppel. Count Rosencrantz was another mounted policeman.
               He came of the Danish noble family of that name, made famous by Shakespeare in
                  <q>Hamlet</q>. Inspector Dickens of the Mounted Police force, was a son of Charles
               Dickens. In fact, names of illustrious English families were so common in the
               Canadian Mounted Police that the force acquired something of that esprit and tone of
               the crack British regiments. The men who joined the Mounted Police might be said to
               be the pick of the remittance men, physically and mentally equipped for that splendid
               service. Some of them are still with the service. Some are the hands of great
               families in England; others have become famous through their own talent and endeavor.
               Among the latter one might mention Sergeant Ralph Kendall, author of <q>Benton of the
                  Royal Mounted</q>, <q>The Luck of the Mounted</q>, and other tales of the mounted
               police. Kendall, himself a mounted policeman, was probably the first and certainly
               the best, of the writers who revealed the celebrated police to the world. His books
               had enormous sales in England and have been the model upon which many writers of
                  <q>Canadian</q> stories have founded their plots. </p>
