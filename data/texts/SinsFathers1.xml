            <p>I think I always knew that we were different from other people—Kit and I. <q>Kit</q>
               was my mother, but I always called her <q>Kit</q>. She used to say that people took
               me for her little brother, and quite often she told people that I was her brother.
               Kit <choice>
                  <sic>was’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wasn’t</corr>
               </choice> like other mothers. She was much prettier. At least I thought so.
               Especially when she had her <q>make up</q> on.</p>
            <p>There were so many things about our life that puzzled me. So many things I did not
               understand, and that I wanted to know about. It was no use asking Kit, for she’d
               nearly always answer:</p>
            <p><q>Don’t ask so many questions. I’m busy! Scram!</q>
            </p>
            <p> I envied other kids who had dads. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have a dad. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have any relatives except Kit. Of course, there was Uncle Jim, but I never
               thought of him as a relative exactly. He used to come to see us several times a
               month. Sometimes he and Kit would go off on some trip, and I <choice>
                  <sic>would’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wouldn’t</corr>
               </choice> see them for days. Other times, Kit would <q>throw</q> a party <pb n="2"/>and I would
               be sent to bed early. It <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> do much good, for I <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic> 
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> sleep what with all that
               noise going on in our house—the shouting and dancing and singing, and the radio and
               piano, and the clinking of glasses and popping of corks. I would be kept awake half
               the night. Once I went down in my pajamas and peeped in at the door of the living
               room, but one of the girls saw me, and Kit jumped up and took me by the ear and led
               me back to bed. I coaxed and begged to be allowed to stay up, but she shook her head
               and led me right up to the bed. She was in a sparkly sort of dress that slung to her
               and made her look almost naked. She had a cigarette dangling from the side of her
               mouth, and a glass of some drink in her hand—it spilled in bubbles over me, as she
               led me along.</p>
            <p><q>How don’t let me hear another word from you</q> said she. She gave me a kiss, and
               I held on to her.</p>
            <p><q>Let me go, or you’ll get me all mussed up</q> said she.</p>
            <p><q>Aw! you’re mussed up anyway</q> said I.</p>
            <p>She gave me a queer look then, and she said:</p>
            <p><q>Right! I know it</q>.</p>
            <p>Then she looked down at me, and for some reason I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> understand, her eyes began to brim over and a tear splashed right down on
               my face----I was in bed by now. Kit looked pretty even when she cried. I remember one
               time Uncle Jim said she was the only woman he knew who could look lovely while
               crying. I don’t remember what it was she was crying about then, with Uncle Jim
               mopping up her <pb n="3"/>tears. She wanted something he said he <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> give her,
               and when she wanted anything real hard she always cried till she got it. She told me
               once she got more things from Uncle Jim through tears than laughs, and she said: <q>I
                  just let them brim over and he falls</q>.</p>
            <p> Now I was <q>falling</q> too.</p>
            <p><q>Don’t cry Kit</q> I pleaded. <q>I’ll be good. I’ll stick in bed</q>.</p>
            <p><q>And go to sleep too</q>.</p>
            <p><q>I can’t sleep with all that noise</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Pull the covers over your head then. I don’t want you to hear anything. <choice>
               <sic>Your</sic>
               <corr>You’re</corr>
               </choice> too
                  young, and besides—</q> She bent and kissed my ear---<q>Little pitchers have big
                  ears</q> said she.</p>
            <p>I didn’t know what that meant.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>We were always moving. We moved from one neighborhood to another. Sometimes we’d
                  move to a new town or city, but never very far from los Angeles, where Kit said we
                  could keep in touch with Uncle Jim. I asked her why we moved so much, as maybe I’d
                  just be enrolled in a new school or gotten acquainted with the boys in the block,
                  and I’d urge Kit not to move. She’d say:</p>
               <p><q>I’m tired of this dump. Besides we’ve got to move</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Well but, lets stay in one place</q>.</p>
               <p>Kit looked at me severely. </p>
               <pb n="4"/>
               <p><q>Now you listen to me. One and for all understand that we move on your
                     account—do you get me?</q></p>
               <p>I shook my head.</p>
               <p><q>Well, <choice>
                  <sic>its</sic>
                  <corr>it’s</corr>
                  </choice> this way, if we don’t keep moving, someones going to walk in on us
                     and take you away from me, see! Did you see that woman who was hanging around
                     here this noon—the one who asked your name, and who your father was. How’d you
                     like to have her take you?</q></p>
               <p><q>She <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice>. I <choice>
                     <sic>would’nt</sic>
                     <corr>wouldn’t</corr>
                     </choice> go with her</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh no—well now try to sell that idea to one of those goldarned ‘Case
                     workers’, that’s what they call them. Say, they’ve been tailing me ever
                  since you were born</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What for?</q></p>
               <p><q><choice><sic>Did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>Didn’t</corr>
               </choice> I tell you not to ask so many questions. Now you get busy helping Lida
                     packing. Scram!</q>.</p>
               <p>She always told me to <q>Scram</q>, and I never did get any of my questions
                  answered. </p>
               <p>So we’d move and we’d move, and the next place it would be the same story.</p>
               <p>We kept maids—colored maids—off and on, according to our circumstances. That was
                  one of the things I never quite understood. When we were, what my mother would
                  jokingly call <q>solvent</q>, then we lived, as she said, on <q>the fat of the
                     land</q>. We had all kinds of good things.</p>
               <p>Then there were lean periods, days when Kit would say she did’nt know where our
                  next meal was coming from. That <pb n="5"/>was when she’d fire the colored maids and pawn her <choice><sic>jewelery</sic><corr>jewelry</corr></choice> or sell it; then her furs and clothes and even the furniture in the house, and she’d get behind with her rent and run up bills till the grocer and the butcher <choice><sic>would’nt</sic><corr>wouldn’t</corr></choice> give her any more credit and would pester her at both the back and front doors, and Kit would hold her head and say she <q>was just going nuts</q> over the whole situation, and though she hated to do it, she’d have to call up that Son of a Something and make up with him again. For these periods of privation always followed one of Kit’s rows with Uncle Jim. They rowed a whole lot too. I used to hear them at it, after I got to bed at night. She’d scream and yell at him, and he’s snarl back at her; or she’d try to be cool and dignified, and he’d hoot at her then and burst out laughing and say:  </p>
               <p><q>Be yourself, Kit—your own cute vulgar self. <choice><sic>Thats</sic><corr>That’s</corr></choice> the way I like you</q>.</p>
               <p>Sometimes she’d throw him out, as she’d tell me, and I’d hear the front door
                  banged on him, and Kit would yell:</p>
               <p><q>I’m through, through, through</q>.</p>
               <p>And she’d run up to my room, and fling herself on the bed beside me and sob and
                  cry, and I’d put my boy arms around her and try to comfort her in my clumsy way. </p>
               <p>After one of these rows, we might’nt see Uncle Jim for weeks—maybe months even,
                  until things got too hard for Kit, and she <choice>
                     <sic>could’nt</sic>
                     <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> make <q>two ends meet</q>, as
                  she said, and then she’d say she wished she had’nt quarreled with him, and </p>
