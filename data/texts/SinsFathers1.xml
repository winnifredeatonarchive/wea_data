            <p>I think I always knew that we were different from other people—Kit and I. <q>Kit</q>
               was my mother, but I always called her <q>Kit</q>. She used to say that people took
               me for her little brother, and quite often she told people that I was her brother.
               Kit <choice>
                  <sic>was’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wasn’t</corr>
               </choice> like other mothers. She was much prettier. At least I thought so.
               Especially when she had her <q>make up</q> on.</p>
            <p>There were so many things about our life that puzzled me. So many things I did not
               understand, and that I wanted to know about. It was no use asking Kit, for she’d
               nearly always answer:</p>
            <p><q>Don’t ask so many questions. I’m busy! Scram!</q>
            </p>
            <p> I envied other kids who had dads. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have a dad. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have any relatives except Kit. Of course, there was Uncle Jim, but I never
               thought of him as a relative exactly. He used to come to see us several times a
               month. Sometimes he and Kit would go off on some trip, and I <choice>
                  <sic>would’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wouldn’t</corr>
               </choice> see them for days. Other times, Kit would <q>throw</q> a party <pb n="2"/>and I would
               be sent to bed early. It <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> do much good, for I <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic> 
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> sleep what with all that
               noise going on in our house—the shouting and dancing and singing, and the radio and
               piano, and the clinking of glasses and popping of corks. I would be kept awake half
               the night. Once I went down in my pajamas and peeped in at the door of the living
               room, but one of the girls saw me, and Kit jumped up and took me by the ear and led
               me back to bed. I coaxed and begged to be allowed to stay up, but she shook her head
               and led me right up to the bed. She was in a sparkly sort of dress that slung to her
               and made her look almost naked. She had a cigarette dangling from the side of her
               mouth, and a glass of some drink in her hand—it spilled in bubbles over me, as she
               led me along.</p>
            <p><q>How don’t let me hear another word from you</q> said she. She gave me a kiss, and
               I held on to her.</p>
            <p><q>Let me go, or you’ll get me all mussed up</q> said she.</p>
            <p><q>Aw! you’re mussed up anyway</q> said I.</p>
            <p>She gave me a queer look then, and she said:</p>
            <p><q>Right! I know it</q>.</p>
            <p>Then she looked down at me, and for some reason I <choice><sic>did’nt</sic> <corr>didn’t</corr></choice> understand, her eyes began
               to brim over and a tear splashed right down on my face----I was in bed by now. kit
               looked pretty even when she cried. I remember one time Uncle Jim said she was the
               only woman he knew who could look lovely while crying. I don’t remember what it was
               she was crying about then, with Uncle Jim mopping up her <pb n="3"/></p>
