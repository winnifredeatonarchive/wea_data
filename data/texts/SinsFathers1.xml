            <div>
            <p>I think I always knew that we were different from other people—Kit and I. <q>Kit</q>
               was my mother, but I always called her <q>Kit</q>. She used to say that people took
               me for her little brother, and quite often she told people that I was her brother.
               Kit <choice>
                  <sic>was’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wasn’t</corr>
               </choice> like other mothers. She was much prettier. At least I thought so.
               Especially when she had her <q>make up</q> on.</p>
            <p>There were so many things about our life that puzzled me. So many things I did not
               understand, and that I wanted to know about. It was no use asking Kit, for she’d
               nearly always answer:</p>
            <p><q>Don’t ask so many questions. I’m busy! Scram!</q>
            </p>
            <p> I envied other kids who had dads. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have a dad. I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> have any relatives except Kit. Of course, there was Uncle Jim, but I never
               thought of him as a relative exactly. He used to come to see us several times a
               month. Sometimes he and Kit would go off on some trip, and I <choice>
                  <sic>would’nt</sic>
                  <corr>wouldn’t</corr>
               </choice> see them for days. Other times, Kit would <q>throw</q> a party <pb n="2"/>and I would
               be sent to bed early. It <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> do much good, for I <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic> 
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> sleep what with all that
               noise going on in our house—the shouting and dancing and singing, and the radio and
               piano, and the clinking of glasses and popping of corks. I would be kept awake half
               the night. Once I went down in my pajamas and peeped in at the door of the living
               room, but one of the girls saw me, and Kit jumped up and took me by the ear and led
               me back to bed. I coaxed and begged to be allowed to stay up, but she shook her head
               and led me right up to the bed. She was in a sparkly sort of dress that slung to her
               and made her look almost naked. She had a cigarette dangling from the side of her
               mouth, and a glass of some drink in her hand—it spilled in bubbles over me, as she
               led me along.</p>
            <p><q>How don’t let me hear another word from you</q> said she. She gave me a kiss, and
               I held on to her.</p>
            <p><q>Let me go, or you’ll get me all mussed up</q> said she.</p>
            <p><q>Aw! you’re mussed up anyway</q> said I.</p>
            <p>She gave me a queer look then, and she said:</p>
            <p><q>Right! I know it</q>.</p>
            <p>Then she looked down at me, and for some reason I <choice>
                  <sic>did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>didn’t</corr>
               </choice> understand, her eyes began to brim over and a tear splashed right down on
               my face----I was in bed by now. Kit looked pretty even when she cried. I remember one
               time Uncle Jim said she was the only woman he knew who could look lovely while
               crying. I don’t remember what it was she was crying about then, with Uncle Jim
               mopping up her <pb n="3"/>tears. She wanted something he said he <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> give her,
               and when she wanted anything real hard she always cried till she got it. She told me
               once she got more things from Uncle Jim through tears than laughs, and she said: <q>I
                  just let them brim over and he falls</q>.</p>
            <p> Now I was <q>falling</q> too.</p>
            <p><q>Don’t cry Kit</q> I pleaded. <q>I’ll be good. I’ll stick in bed</q>.</p>
            <p><q>And go to sleep too</q>.</p>
            <p><q>I can’t sleep with all that noise</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Pull the covers over your head then. I don’t want you to hear anything. <choice>
               <sic>Your</sic>
               <corr>You’re</corr>
               </choice> too
                  young, and besides—</q> She bent and kissed my ear---<q>Little pitchers have big
                  ears</q> said she.</p>
            <p>I didn’t know what that meant.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
               <p>We were always moving. We moved from one neighborhood to another. Sometimes we’d
                  move to a new town or city, but never very far from los Angeles, where Kit said we
                  could keep in touch with Uncle Jim. I asked her why we moved so much, as maybe I’d
                  just be enrolled in a new school or gotten acquainted with the boys in the block,
                  and I’d urge Kit not to move. She’d say:</p>
               <p><q>I’m tired of this dump. Besides we’ve got to move</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Well but, lets stay in one place</q>.</p>
               <p>Kit looked at me severely. </p>
               <pb n="4"/>
               <p><q>Now you listen to me. One and for all understand that we move on your
                     account—do you get me?</q></p>
               <p>I shook my head.</p>
               <p><q>Well, <choice>
                  <sic>its</sic>
                  <corr>it’s</corr>
                  </choice> this way, if we don’t keep moving, someones going to walk in on us
                     and take you away from me, see! Did you see that woman who was hanging around
                     here this noon—the one who asked your name, and who your father was. How’d you
                     like to have her take you?</q></p>
               <p><q>She <choice>
                  <sic>could’nt</sic>
                  <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice>. I <choice>
                     <sic>would’nt</sic>
                     <corr>wouldn’t</corr>
                     </choice> go with her</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh no—well now try to sell that idea to one of those goldarned ‘Case
                     workers’, that’s what they call them. Say, they’ve been tailing me ever
                  since you were born</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What for?</q></p>
               <p><q><choice><sic>Did’nt</sic>
                  <corr>Didn’t</corr>
               </choice> I tell you not to ask so many questions. Now you get busy helping Lida
                     packing. Scram!</q>.</p>
               <p>She always told me to <q>Scram</q>, and I never did get any of my questions
                  answered. </p>
               <p>So we’d move and we’d move, and the next place it would be the same story.</p>
               <p>We kept maids—colored maids—off and on, according to our circumstances. That was
                  one of the things I never quite understood. When we were, what my mother would
                  jokingly call <q>solvent</q>, then we lived, as she said, on <q>the fat of the
                     land</q>. We had all kinds of good things.</p>
               <p>Then there were lean periods, days when Kit would say she did’nt know where our
                  next meal was coming from. That <pb n="5"/>was when she’d fire the colored maids and pawn her <choice><sic>jewelery</sic><corr>jewelry</corr></choice> or sell it; then her furs and clothes and even the furniture in the house, and she’d get behind with her rent and run up bills till the grocer and the butcher <choice><sic>would’nt</sic><corr>wouldn’t</corr></choice> give her any more credit and would pester her at both the back and front doors, and Kit would hold her head and say she <q>was just going nuts</q> over the whole situation, and though she hated to do it, she’d have to call up that Son of a Something and make up with him again. For these periods of privation always followed one of Kit’s rows with Uncle Jim. They rowed a whole lot too. I used to hear them at it, after I got to bed at night. She’d scream and yell at him, and he’s snarl back at her; or she’d try to be cool and dignified, and he’d hoot at her then and burst out laughing and say:  </p>
               <p><q>Be yourself, Kit—your own cute vulgar self. <choice><sic>Thats</sic><corr>That’s</corr></choice> the way I like you</q>.</p>
               <p>Sometimes she’d throw him out, as she’d tell me, and I’d hear the front door
                  banged on him, and Kit would yell:</p>
               <p><q>I’m through, through, through</q>.</p>
               <p>And she’d run up to my room, and fling herself on the bed beside me and sob and
                  cry, and I’d put my boy arms around her and try to comfort her in my clumsy way. </p>
               <p>After one of these rows, we might’nt see Uncle Jim for weeks—maybe months even,
                  until things got too hard for Kit, and she <choice>
                     <sic>could’nt</sic>
                     <corr>couldn’t</corr>
                  </choice> make <q>two ends meet</q>, as
                  she said, and then she’d say she wished she had’nt quarreled with him, and <pb n="6"/>she would’nt have if he <choice><sic>had’nt</sic><corr>hadn’t</corr></choice> been so stinking drunk, and she’d <choice><sic>sau</sic><corr>say</corr></choice> when he was
                  sober there was no one nicer than he was, but when he was drunk, he <choice><sic>was’nt</sic><corr>wasn’t</corr></choice>
                  human—he was a maniac, and how anh poor girl had to put up with him as she had for
                  years was beyond her.</p>
              
               <p>So by and by, she’d start telephoning him <choice><sic>a,d</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> she’d say in a sweet sad voice:</p>
            
               <p><q>Hello Jimminy! How are you?</q></p>
              
               <p>He’d hang up the telephone. Then Kit would ring again, and she’d have some trouble
                  getting him. Maybe he’d leave the receiver off the hook, but she’d get him
                  finally, and then she’d shout all sorts of insulting names and things at him, and
                  she’d say that he’d better come across, and come across PDQ, or she’d take a
                  little stroll over to his house, and have a nice personal and private interview
                  with a certain somebody.</p>
           
               <p>That usually brought him. I think though he was always glad to get back to us, for
                  he’d <choice><sic>sat</sic><corr>sit</corr></choice> like a big boob when he’d come into the house, and first thing you knew
                  he and Kit would be hugging and kissing each other and Kit would say:</p>
              
               <p><q>Run on Tony---Scram!</q></p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
               <p>About Uncle Jim. Once a boy down our street said his mother said Uncle Jim was’nt
                  my real Uncle, and he said: <q>Better go ask her who he is</q>.</p>
              
               <p>I hurried home to Kit.</p>
               <pb n="7"/>
               <p><q>Kit</q> said I, <q><choice><sic>theres</sic><corr>there’s</corr></choice> a boy down the street named Jack Downs, and he said
                     his mother said Uncle Jim <choice><sic>was’nt</sic><corr>wasn’t</corr></choice> my uncle—I said he was a liar and that he was
                     my uncle. He is, <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice> he</q>.</p>
               <p>Kit’s blue eyes got wide and dark. the cigarette slipped from between her
                  lips.</p>
               <p><q>So they’re shooting off their mouths, are they?</q></p>
               <p><q>Jack Downs says everyone’s talking about us and---</q></p>
               <p><q>Let them talk! Let them</q> said Kit fiercely.</p>
               <p><q><choice><sic>Thats</sic><corr>That’s</corr></choice> all they’re good for, the dirty old gossips. We’ll move out of this
                     lousy neighborhood. We’ll go somewhere, where <choice><sic>peopl</sic><corr>people</corr></choice> let us live our own life in
                     our way, and you can tell them I said so</q>.</p>
               <pb n="8"/>
               <p>I think I was beginning to hate him. Although there were times when he had a
                  serious attraction for me, yet taken all in all, I resented him. There was a
                  rivalry between us, I suppose. I felt this more, as I grew older. Yet in spite of
                  this, I think he tried his best to be kind to me, and in a rough sort of way I
                  think he even was fond of me. He would have jovial moods, and then he’d talk to
                  me, man to man. He’d roll up his sleeves and teach me how to box, and sometimes
                  we’d wrestle and go into a clinch. He said he was going to take me fishing and
                  hunting when his family got off to Europe, and there were lots of things we’d do
                  together. I liked him at those times, though I <choice> <sic>could’nt</sic><corr>couldn’t</corr></choice> down my intuitive distrust
                  and suspicion. I hated the way he looked at Kit—the way he kissed her—right before
                  me. I wanted to hit him then, and my hands used to twist up into fists then. </p>
               <p>Once he put his arm around my shoulder, and told Kit to take a look at us:</p>
               <p><q>Chip or the old block, hehe?</q> he chortled.</p>
               <p><q>Why not?</q> laughed Kit.</p>
               <p>I <choice><sic>did’nt</sic><corr>didn’t</corr></choice> know then what that meant. I do now of course.</p>
               <p>I suppose, taken all in all, he was pretty good to me, what with all the presents
                  and fine things he brought me, but I had to keep out of his way when he was
                  drinking, for then, as Kit said, he <choice><sic>was’nt</sic><corr>wasn’t</corr></choice> human, and he might do or say
                  anything.</p>
               <pb n="9"/>
               <p>On my eleventh birthday I had a party; or rather I started to have a party. we
                  were living then in a pretty bungalow on Alpine Avenue. <choice><sic>Eucalptus</sic><corr>Eucalyptus</corr></choice> and walnut
                  trees shaded our lawns, and we had climbing red geraniums and roses and
                  poinsettias all over the grounds. The house was new, and ever so nice, and Kit and
                  I liked it so much. Kit said Uncle Jim had given it to us for a birthday present,
                  and she said this time she hoped we’d stay put. She said she had chosen the
                  neighborhood especially because it was so quiet, refined and respectable. </p>
               <p>We had been living there about a month, and Kit gotten acquainted with some of the
                  neighbors, and was feeling awfully good about it. Two or three of them had even
                  called on Kit, and she was really delighted. She said she knew she had made a good
                  impression on them, and she hoped I’d do and say nothing to spoil that impression.
                  She said to be very careful what I said to the neighbors, and if they asked any
                  questions about us, I was to say Kit was a widow and Uncle Jim was my dead
                  father’s brother. I argued:</p>
               <p><q>But how can he be my dead father’s brother if his name <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice> the same as
                     ours</q>.</p>
               <p>Kit saw the point and she said:</p>
               <p><q>Right you are. Lets see now. what had we better say? Well, suppose we say he’s
                     my brother</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But he <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice></q> said I stoutly. <q>I’m glad he <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice> <choice><sic>to</sic><corr>too</corr></choice>. I don’t like him
                     anyway</q>.</p>
               <p>Kit gave me a hard look—almost a frown. She said:</p>
               <p><q>Oh, so you don’t like your bread and butter, eh?</q></p>
               <pb n="10"/>
               <p><q>What?</q></p>
               <p><q>Bread and butter is what I said. <choice><sic>Thats</sic><corr>That’s</corr></choice> what Uncle Jim is to us---our meal ticket.
                  So you better get over your dislike</q> she added vehemently. <q>Besides <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it’s</corr></choice> not
                  natural</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Why <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice> it?</q></p>
               <p><q>Because it <choice><sic>is’nt</sic><corr>isn’t</corr></choice>, and stop asking questions</q>.</p>

               <p>About my birthday party. Kit had the table set for about fifteen kids of our
                  neighborhood. She said they were all children of the best and most refined
                  <choice><sic>familes</sic><corr>families</corr></choice>. She had sent out little printed cards of invitation, and she had called
                  up some of their homes. Anyway, she said they had all accepted. I had a cake with
                  eleven red candles on it, and it was a huge cake. It had to be because it was
                  hollow inside the middle of it, and packed full of little toys and souvenirs. You
                  pulled a string and out they jumped to the top. That was after you blew out the
                  candles. There were all kinds of other good things on the table too—cakes and
                  candles and little sandwiches and chicken and mushroom patties and all kinds of
                  things. Kit said it was as good as any millionaire kid’s table. And the presents!
                  You’d have thought Kit had bought out a store.</p>
               <p>Imagine then how we felt when no one came to my party. not a single kid. We waited
                  and we waited, but they just did’nt come, and Kit became restless and nervous, and
                  by and by she would say:</p>
             <pb n="11"/>
               <p><q>They’re a <choice><sic>bir</sic><corr>bit</corr></choice> late</q></p>
               <p>or: <q>I wonder if that clock’s right</q></p>
               <p>or: <q>They say <choice><sic>its</sic><corr>it’s</corr></choice> ritz to be late to a party</q>.</p>
               <p>She could’nt keep that up however, so she began calling up the neighbors, and I
                  don’t know what they said to her, but it made Kit wild, and after she had tried
                  two or three of them, she hung up and stood by the phone looking stricken and
                  frozen like. Then she run suddenly up to me and she hugged me up tight, and she
                  kind of laughed and cried a moment and then she said:</p>
               <p><q>Hell, what does it matter anyway?</q></p>
               <p>And she said she was only kidding me that she’d invited ithers, and we’d have a
                  swell party just to ourselves. So I cut the cake and blow out the candles, and
                  pulled the strings so I got all the little toys in the cake, and I ate all the
                  stuff I could, and by and by I got sleepy and tired, and went off to bed,
                  forgetting it all.</p>
               <p>Loud voices in Kit’s room woke me up in the middle of the night. Kit was
                  screaming, and Uncle Jim was shouting back at her. Kit was in an awdul rage,
                  because she said that those cats had tried to out her, and she blamed him and he
                  said it was her own fault and that it was her idea to move into this type of a
                  neighborhood where she did’nt belong, and that possibly after calling on her, the
                  neighbors had gotten wise to something. Kit said:</p>
               <p><q>Yes, probably wise to <emph>you</emph></q></p>
               <p>He said:</p>
               
               
               <pb n="29"/>
               
               <p><q>What you bawlin about?</q></p>
               <p><q>I’m not</q> says he. <q>Gee! I’m just tickled to death about something, and
                     so’ll you be when I tell you. Say tony, what do you think, you and I are going
                     off together. Its all arranged. Mom says its all right too and---</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I can’t</q> said I dully. <q>Guess you don’t realize that I got to go to my
                     mother</q>.</p>
               <p>His eyes filled up again. He tried several times to tell me and at last blurted
                  out:</p>
               <p><q>You c-can’t Tony, cause she’s---she died Tony. Your mother did</q>.</p>
               <p>I took that in dazedly. I did’nt quite comprehend what that meant. I put my hand
                  up to my head---both my hands, and I hold it—my poor, dumb head. I could hear Kemp
                  jabbering away, but all I could think of was Kit---poor little cute vulgar Kit.
                  She was my mother you know, and she’d loved me and I’d loved her and---well---I
                  just couln’nt think of her as---</p>
               <p>I kind of became aware of Kemp’s head next to mine. We were both kind of leaning
                  against the stone gate, and I guess he was sobbing too. I was the first to get
                  some sort of command of myself, and I said:</p>
               <p><q>Well, can you tie that. I don’t quite know what I’ll do now</q>.</p>
               <p>Kemp brightened right up.</p>
               <p><q>You’ll be with us. We’re going on a long trip---maybe to Europe. We’ll always
                     be together, you and me</q>.</p>
               <pb n="30"/>
               <p>I felt kind of older than Kemp. He had’nt been through what I had. I said
                  wearily:</p>
               <p><q>You’re a swell pal all right Kemp, but I guess you don’t understand. I <choice> <sic>could’nt</sic><corr>couldn’t</corr></choice>
                     stay with you. You don’t know about me---you don’t know what your father called
                     me</q>.</p>
               <p><q>He was your father too</q>, Kemp flashed back.</p>
               <p><q>Yes—but it was different. He called me——</q>
               </p>
               <p><q>Well I’ll tell you what I call you---</q>
               </p>
               <p><q>Well what?</q></p>
               <p><q>You’re my brother</q> said he.</p>
