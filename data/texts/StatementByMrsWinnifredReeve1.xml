         <head>Statement by Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</head>
         <opener>
            <byline>By <name ref="pers:WE1">Mrs. Winnifred Reeve</name></byline>
         </opener>

         <div>
            <p>When I wrote the letter that appeared in the March issue of <q>The Canadian
                  Bookman</q> I was smarting under a sense of personal injury and hurt. After I had
               written it I tried to believe I had done a service to Canadian letters and Canadian
               authors; but all the while I was troubled by the feeling that it was an ignoble thing
               to do.</p>
            <p>I was a veteran author, and should have assisted and protected the new young writer
               coming with her first work, a brilliant production on which I had myself expended
               unstinted praise. I should not have allowed what I thought was an unkind and
               ungrateful act on her part toward me to have hurt me. Few of us can rise above our
               personalities.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Salversen denies that she told me she was paying Mr. Bothwell for his services.
               I shall not dispute it. The conversation took place in the presence of myself and my
               daughter. We all are liable to make mistakes.</p>
            <p>I am making this statement voluntarily, and through no pressure, but because I desire
               to clarify the situation and say something that may to some degree salve the hurt
               feelings of Mrs. Salversen.</p>
