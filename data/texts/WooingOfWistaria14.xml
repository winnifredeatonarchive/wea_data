               <head>I</head>
               <p>When after a life that had never lacked variety the Lady Wistaria came to the
                  years of <choice>
                     <sic>tranquillity</sic>
                     <corr>tranquility</corr>
                  </choice>, she was wont to say, with the philosophy that follows dangerous times:
                     <q>No one, man or maid, ever really began to live before the time to which the
                     first memory reverts</q>.</p>
               <p>The first recollection of the Lady Wistaria goes back to an earlier childhood than
                  that of most mortals. This she ascribed to its terrible and awful import. She
                  could scarcely do more than move with the uncertain direction of babyhood, when<pb n="2"/>her father, always now in her memory as gaunt, lean, haggard, tall, had
                  taken her upon a long journey. They had travelled partly by <foreign xml:lang="ja">kurumaya</foreign>, and, towards the end, on foot. That is, her father had
                  walked, carry8ing her on high in his arms. </p>
               <p>When they halted at Yedo they stood amid a vast concourse of people, who remained
                  silent and respectful against the background of the buildings, while in the centre
                  of the road marched steadily and pompously a great glittering pageant.</p>
               <p>Wisteria had clapped her hands with glee and delight at the mass of color, the
                  glimmer of shield and breastplate, the prancing, snorting horses. But her father
                  suddenly had raised an enormous hand and in a moment had stopped her delight.
                  Wisteria lapsed into an acute silence.</p>
               <p>Instantly she was awakened from her painful apathy by her father, who moved her
                  higher in his arms, and turned her head slowly about with one hand, while with the
                  other he pointed to a shining personage reclining in a palanquin borne high on the
                  shoulders of ten stout-legged attendants.</p>
               <p><q>My daughter</q>, said her father’s hollow voice in her ear, <q>yonder rides the
                     man who killed your mother. It is through his crime that you are orphaned and
                     have no mother to care for you and love you. Look at him well! Hush! Do not
                     weep or shake with <pb n="3"/>fear, but turn your eyes upon him. Look at him!
                     Look! Look! Yonder rides your mother’s murderer. Do not forget his face as long
                     as you live. It is your duty to remember it!</q></p>
               <p>Whereupon Wistaria, who, in obedience to her father’s commands, had stared with
                  wide eyes fixedly at the reclining noble, set up a most extraordinary cry. It was
                  unlike that of a little child—a wild, wailing shriek, so weird and piteous that
                  the bystanders started in horror and fear. The noble raised himself lazily on his
                  elbow, starting across the heads of all, until his eyes rested upon the man with
                  the child held on high. He fell back with an uneasy shrug of the shoulders. </p>
               <p>That was the Lady Wistaria’s oldest memory. There were others, but none so vivid
                  as this, the first of all. Even later, when she had ceased to be a child, she had
                  been unable to pierce the mystery of her father’s life, or indeed her own.</p>
               <p> One half of her earlier years had been spent in a small, whitewashed cottage,
                  built on the crest of a little wind-blown hill, far enough removed from the
                  dwellings in the village below to be entirely cut off from them.</p>
               <p>There was a touch of the uncanny and weird about the little village, whose slender
                  streets, ascending and descending, zigzagging up and down, disappeared among
                  hillocks <pb n="4"/> and bluffs, though built in reality in the hollow outskirts
                  of a flourishing city at the foot of a small chain of mountains. Through the land
                  here was green and beautiful at all times of the year, there came no one from the
                  great city beyond to this solitary settlement, whose inhabitants bore the impress
                  of toil, pain, and oppression.</p>
               <p>Why her father, who, she had been told, was of noble blood, resided here on this
                  hilltop, isolated even from the strange people who dwelt in the silent village
                  below, the Lady Wistaria had never learned. When she had questioned her uncle and
                  aunt, she had been frigidly informed that curiosity and inquisitiveness were
                  degrading traits, which a maiden should strive with all her strength to overcome.
                  Neither did she ask her father, who, taciturn and cold during her brief residence
                  each year in his house, gave her no opportunity for winning his confidence. His
                  love Wistaria had never dreamed of possessing. </p>
               <p>Nevertheless, whenever she went to her father’s house, a wistful longing and
                  yearning for him possessed her whole being, and when she departed she would hide
                  her face in her sleeve, weeping silently, not knowing why she should weep, and
                  scarcely conscious of the fact that she wept for lack of her father’s love.</p>
               <p> In her father’s house there were no servants, <pb n="5"/> no maids, no
                  attendants—only one weazened, blind, and infinitely old woman, who wept tears from
                  her sightless eyes upon her arrival, who sang and crooned to her at night in a
                  sobbing, sighing voice, that was as sweet and pure as a girl’s.</p>
               <p>She addressed the old woman as <q>Madame Mume</q>, and preserved always towards
                  her the reserved and dignified attitude of the mistress to the maid. Yet her
                  father addressed her as <q>Mother</q>. Wisteria knew the old woman was not his
                  mother, and she could not believe she was even akin to them; for had she not
                  always been taught that the family from which she was descended was one of the
                  oldest and noblest in Japan, while old Madame Mume, though gentle and good, wore
                  the garb of the poor <foreign xml:lang="ja">heimin</foreign>.</p>
               <p> The other half of her childhood had been spent at the home of her uncle. Here
                  were countless retainers and servants, besides a host of <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, petty vassals, soldiers, peasants, and citizens, who lived
                  upon his land and owed their direct allegiance to him. </p>
               <p> The garden walls surrounding her uncle’s palace were tall and of massive
                  structure, built of solid stone. Its gates were guarded by handsome, bold <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> clad in thick armor. The steel upon their
                  breasts and shoulders glistened with a sinister sheen, and beneath their blazing
                  helmets fierce eyes burned out their unswerving allegiance and <pb n="6"/> loyalty
                  to their lord and their scorn and defiance of all his enemies. Their coats, all
                  emblazoned and embroidered with golden dragons, bore two crests, that of the
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> Iyesada, and that of the powerful
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">Daimio</foreign> under whom they served, the Lord of
                  Catzu, uncle of the Lady Wistaria. </p>
               <p> Here in her uncle’s palace, Wistaria was watched over, cared for, nurtured, and
                  refined. Lackeys and servants were about her on all sides, ready to spring to her
                  service. As a child she had attended a private school, kept by an old <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, where with half a dozen other little girls she
                  had squatted on small, padded mats before writing-tables but twelve inches high,
                  and had been taught the intricacies of the language. Two gorgeously liveried
                  attendants always accompanied her to and from the school-house, carrying her
                  books, her writing-box, her keeling-cushion, and her little table. </p>
               <p>When she grew older she attended the elementary school. After she had left this, a
                  silent woman of perfect manners and exquisite appearance had come to her uncle’s
                  palace and attached herself entirely to her. With the coming of this governess,
                  wisteria ceased to pay her annual visits to her father’s house. He himself came to
                  the palace instead, once every year. Upon these occasions Wistaria was brought
                  into his presence. He would put a few stern questions to her <pb n="7"/>
                  concerning her knowledge of her duty to her parents, to which Wistaria would
                  respond with expressions of filial submission to his will in all things.</p>
               <p>From the governess, Wistaria learned the elegancies of conversation and how to act
                  on meeting great personages at court. She had even been drilled in certain graces
                  which should not fail to enchain her lover, when he, the proper one, should be
                  chosen for her. </p>
               <p>Now that she had reached the age of fifteen years, this perfect person had
                  departed from the palace to teach maidens of younger years. The Lady Wistaria had
                  arrived at an age when she could be said to have been graduated from her
                  governess’s hands as competent to pass the rest of her life without further
                  instruction, save that constant restraint exercised over her by her aunt, the Lady
                  Evening Glory of Catzu.</p>

               <head>II</head>
               <p>The education of a Japanese maid is not alone a matter of cultivating the mind; it
                  is an actual <choice>
                     <sic>moulding</sic>
                     <corr>molding</corr>
                  </choice> of her whole character. The average girl under such discipline succumbs
                  to the hereditary instinct of implicit obedience to her dictators, and becomes
                  like unto their conception of what she would be. But the Lady Wistaria was not an
                  average girl. That is the reason her appearance at the court of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> in Yedo created a <choice>
                     <sic>furore</sic>
                     <corr>furor</corr>
                  </choice>. Her fresh, young beauty, her grace and bewitch-<pb n="9"/>ing charm,
                  were a revelation to the jaded court.</p>
               <p>The Lady Evening Glory, who had spent years of thought and preparation for this
                  event, had warned her repeatedly that upon such an auspicious occasion she was to
                  tread across the vast hall with downcast eyes and an attitude of graceful
                  humility. She was on no account to look about her. While all eyes might gaze upon
                  her, she must see no one. And this is how the Lady Wistaria carried out her
                  instructions.</p>
               <p>When first she began the slow parade towards the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s throne, my lady’s head was drooped in the correct pose,
                  with her eyes modestly downcast. She had proceeded but a few paces, however, when
                  she was thrilled by the intuition that the spectacle was worthy of any sacrifice
                  necessary to see it. Her small head began to erect itself. Her eyes, wide open,
                  with one great sweep viewed the splendor of the picture—the graceful courtiers,
                  the lovely women in their costumes of the sun. A sharp pinch upon the arm brought
                  her back to the exacting presence of the Lady Evening Glory beside her. Down
                  drooped her head again. Gradually the eyelids fluttered. My lady peeped!</p>
               <p>There was a low murmur throughout the hall. The waving of fans ceased a space. The
                  Lady Evening Glory recognizsed the significance of that murmur, and then the <pb n="10"/> hush that ensued. A tremendous fluttering pride arose in her bosom.
                  Her experience of many years assured her that her niece’s beauty was compelling
                  its splendid tribute.</p>
               <p>Then the Lady Wistaria was presented to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>. Her prostration was made with inimitable grace. Her beauty
                  and charm called forth words of praise from the Shogun himself to her uncle.</p>
               <p>A young noble, more daring and ardent than all the others, separated himself from
                  the assembled company, and, crossing to where the Lady Wistaria stood, kissed a
                  hyacinth and dropped it at the girl’s feet.</p>
               <p>The Lady Evening Glory could have shrieked aloud with fury at the action of her
                  niece, due solely to her innocence. She had no thought whence it had come. A
                  flower in her path was not something she could tread upon, or even pass by. There
                  in the centre of the gorgeous hall she stooped tenderly and picked up the pleading
                  flower.</p>
               <p><q>Wild girl!</q> cried her aunt, in a suffocating whisper.</p>
               <p> Wisteria started with a little cry of genuine dismay. She had forgotten in one
                  moment the instruction of years. In her confusion she stopped short in her
                  progress across the hall. As if impelled by some great subtle force within her,
                  helplessly the Lady Wistaria raised her eyes. They gazed immediately into the
                  depths of another pair, afire with an <pb n="11"/> awakening passion. The next
                  moment the young girl had blushed, red as the tints a masterful sun throws to
                  coquetting clouds at sunset. </p>
               <p>All the journey through, to their temporary palace in Yedo, her aunt abused the
                  Lady Wistaria. The training of years wasted! Ingratitude was the basest of crimes!
                  Was this the way she repaid her aunt’s labor and kindness? Well, back to Catzu
                  they should go. It would be unsafe to remain longer in the capital. Certainly her
                  niece had much to learn before she could continue in Yedo longer than a day.</p>
               <p>The Lady Wistaria sat back in her palanquin, pouting. What, to be taken from the
                  gay capital one day after arriving—before she had had the chance to meet or even
                  speak to any one! Oh! it was cruel, and she the most stupid of maidens not to have
                  comported herself correctly at her presentation! </p>
               <p><q>Dearest, my lady aunt</q>, said she, <q>pray you, do let us continue in the
                     capital for the season</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What! And be laughed at by the whole court for our shocking and magnificently
                     bad manners? People will declare that you have been reared in the fields with
                     the peasants</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Do not, I beg, blame me for an accident, dear, my honorable aunt. It was not,
                     in truth, my own fault</q>.</p>
               <pb n="12"/>
               <p><q>Indeed!</q></p>
               <p><q>Indeed, I do assure you it was the fault of that honorably silly
                  flower</q>.</p>
               <p><q>TSHH!</q></p>
               <p><q>And of that magnificent and augustly handsome courtier who dropped it</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Dropped it! My lady niece, I saw the impudent fellow throw it at your
                  feet!</q></p>
               <p><q>What! You saw! Oh, my aunt, then it is you who are jointly guilty with
                  me!</q></p>
               <p><q>What is that?</q> cried the aunt, angrily.</p>
               <p><q>Why, my lady, your honorable eyes were improper also</q>.</p>
               <p>The Lady Evening Glory turned an offended shoulder.</p>
               <p><q>We will start to-morrow for home</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, my lady!</q></p>
               <p><q>I have spoken</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But, dear aunt—</q>
               </p>
               <p><q>Will you condescend to tell me, girl, who is guarding, thou or I?</q></p>
               <p>With the Lady Evening Glory, <q>thou</q> was the end of discussion.</p>
               <p>The following day, therefore, the returning cortège set out for Catzu. As fortune
                  would have it, the Lady Evening Glory travelled in her own train, while her niece
                  had also her personal retinue about her. Consequently the journey was joyous for
                  the Lady Wistaria.</p>
               <p>When first the cortège began to move through the city a strange little procession
                  followed in its wake. It was made up of the love-<pb n="13"/> sick suitors, who,
                  having but once gazed upon the beauty of the Lady Wistaria, wished to serve and
                  follow her to the end of the world. The following was quite large when the cortège
                  started. A number dropped off as they reached the city limits, then gradually the
                  hopeless and disappointed swains with drooping heads turned back to Yedo, there to
                  dream of the vision of a day, but to dream hopelessly. </p>
               <p>Wherever the Lady Wistaria’s personal train travelled there lay scattered upon the
                  ground, and blowing in the air above and about her, tiny bits of white or
                  delicately tinted and perfumed paper. They were, alas! The love-letters and poems
                  penned by the ardent lovers, which the hard-hearted lady, tearing into
                  infinitesimal bits, had saucily tossed to the winds. It was thus she tossed their
                  love from her, she would have them believe. </p>
               <p>Hopeless, and finally indignant, therefore, backward turned these erstwhile
                  hopeful suitors. </p>
               <p>Sir Genji, the big <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, who had especial
                  charge of Wistaria’s train, reported to her, with a smile of satisfaction, that
                  she would suffer no further annoyance, as all save one of her suitors had finally
                  retreated. </p>
               <p><q>Bring closer your honorable head</q>, said the lady to Genji, who strode beside
                  her <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>, ever and anon ordering and,
                  scolding the runners.</p>
               <p>He brought his ear closer to the girl’s lips.<pb n="14"/> She leaned over and
                  whispered, while a pale pink flush came, fled, and grew and deepened again in her
                  face.</p>
               <p><q>Tell me</q>, said she, <q>which of the honorably bold and silly cavaliers is it
                     that remains?</q></p>
               <p><q>The one, my lady, who, not content with despatching his love-letters and tokens
                     to you by underlings, has had the august impertinence to deliver them himself
                     in person</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Yes—ye-es—of course</q>, said Wistaria, blushing deliciously, <q>and that was
                     honorably right. Fo you not think so, my brave Genji?</q></p>
               <p><q>Perhaps</q>, admitted the astute <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>,
                  frowning at the same time upon a portion of the parade belonging to the Lady
                  Evening Glory. Wisteria laughed with infinite relish. </p>
               <p><q>Well</q>, she said, <q>if my honorable aunt or august uncle were to learn of
                     his boldness, I fear me they would command that the curtains of my
                     insignificant <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimon</foreign> be drawn so tightly that
                     I should surely suffocate</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Fear not</q>, said Genji, <q>I shall take immediate measures to prevent such an
                     occurrence, my lady</q>.</p>
               <p>Wisteria pouted, and frowned as heavily as it is possible for bright eyes and rosy
                  lips to do. She toyed with her fan, opening and closing it several times.</p>
               <p><q>You are honorably over-zealous, Sir Genji</q>, she said. </p>
               <pb n="15"/>
               <p><q>My lady</q>, he replied, <q>know you aught of this stranger?</q></p>
               <p><q>He has a pretty grace</q>, said Wistaria, <q>and the bearing of one of noble
                     rank. Have you not noted, Sir Genji, the beauty and richness of his magnificent
                     attire?</q></p>
               <p><q>I have, my lady. It is of that attire I would speak</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Do so at once, then</q>.</p>
               <p><q>It is the attire, my lady, of the Mori family</q>.</p>
               <p><q>The Mori! What! Our honorably hostile neighbors?</q></p>
               <p><q>Exactly</q>, said Genji.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, dear!</q> murmured Wistaria, as she sank back in her cushions in troubled
                  thought. After a moment her little black head again appeared.</p>
               <p><q>Gen</q>, she cried, <q>come hither once more</q>.</p>
               <p><q>My lady?</q></p>
               <p><q>A little closer, if you please. So! Know you not, Sir Gen, that my lady aunt,
                     and indeed also my own august father, once served this odious Mori
                  prince?</q></p>
               <p><q>I have herd so, my lady</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Well, then, truly <emph>all</emph> of the members of this honorable clan cannot
                     be augustly bad!</q></p>
               <p>Sir Genji could not restrain a smile.</p>
               <p><q>Indeed, my lady, this Choshui people have many worthy and admirable
                     qualities</q>.</p>
               <p><q>You are a very clever fellow, my dear Sir Gen</q>, said Wistaria, smiling
                  engagingly <pb n="16"/>now, <q>and I shall bespeak you to my honorable uncle. And
                     now—now—if you would really wish to serve me, do you pray show some
                     kindness—some little insignificant courtesy to this unfortunate Mori courtier.
                     Perhaps he may have some good attributes</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Undoubtedly, my lady</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And do be careful to allow my lady aunt to know naught concerning him, for she,
                     having come from this Mori, is actually more sour against them than we, you and
                     I, Sir Gen, who have not indeed</q>.</p>
               <p>Just then my lady heard a familiar tramp to the left of her <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>. There were but few horses in the cortège, and most of them
                  had gone ahead with her father’s <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>.
                  Consequently the beat of a horse’s hoofs was plainly to be heard. The Lady
                  Wistaria wavered between lying back in her carriage and drawing about her
                  discreetly the curtains, or sitting up and feigning indifference to the horseman. </p>
               <p>The rider had fallen into a slow trot behind her <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>, and seemed to be making no effort either to overtake or
                  ride beside her. For the space of a few minutes the Lady Wistaria, with a bright,
                  expectant red spot in either cheek, waited for some sign on the part of the rider.
                  His stubborn continuance in the background at first thrilled, then irritated, and
                  finally distracted her. My lady put her shining little head out of the vehicle,<pb n="17"/>then, leaning quite far out, she looked backward. Instantly the rider
                  spurred his horse forward. In a flash his hitherto melancholy face became luminous
                  with hope. A moment later he was beside the lady’s <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>. Before her officious maid had time to draw the curtains a
                  love-letter had fallen into my lady’s lap. </p>
               <p>It was possibly the fiftieth appeal he had penned to her. Hitherto he had born the
                  bitter chagrin of seeing the torn bits of paper fall from a little hand that
                  parted the silken curtains of her gilded norimono and scattered them to the
                  winds.</p>
               <p>The lover rode within sight of his mistress’s palanquin until the first gray
                  darkness of approaching night crept like an immense cloud over the heaven, chasing
                  away the enchanting rosy tints that the departing sun had left behind. </p>
               <p>Undaunted by the fact that his letter received no response, encouraged rather by
                  the fact that it had not shared the fate of its predecessors, the lover now set
                  himself to the task of composing more ardent and flowery epistles. What time was
                  not occupied in eagerly watching for the smallest glimpse of the little head to
                  appear was spent in writing to her. He wrote his love-letters and poems with a
                  shaking hand even while his horse carried him onward. He wrote them by the light
                  of the moon when the train halted<pb n="18"/>for the night. He wrote them in the
                  early dawn before the cortège had awakened. And he delivered them at all hours,
                  whenever he could obtain opportunity.</p>
               <p>Though the Lady Wistaria by this time must have acquired a goodly quantity of
                  useless literature, she took no measure to relieve herself of the burdensome
                  baggage. Nevertheless the lover began to despair. A few hours before they reached
                  her uncle’s province but into the very grounds surrounding his palace—into the
                  palace itself if necessary. He besought her that she would send him one small word
                  of favor.</p>
               <p>He waited in impatient excitement for a response to this last fervid appeal. He
                  felt sure she must at least deign to express her wish in the matter. But when they
                  reached the province he saw her carried across the borders without having given
                  him one sign or token.</p>
               <p>In his despair he dismounted, and was divided between returning to Yedo or
                  continuing his hopeless quest.</p>
               <p>As he remained plunged in his gloomy reflections and uncertainty of purpose, an
                  enormous <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> touched him sharply upon the
                  arm. In his irritation he was about to<pb n="19"/>resent the fellow’s familiarity,
                  when he perceived a little roll of rice-paper protruding from his sleeve.
                  Stealthily the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> reached out his arm to the
                  lover. The latter seized the scroll eagerly. </p>
            </div>
            <pb n="20"/>
            <div type="chapter" n="3">
               <head>III</head>
               <p>The palace, and indeed the whole domain of the Lord Catzu, presented the
                  appearance of being constantly armed as though for attack, a not uncommon thing in
                  the latter days of feudalism. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> had been
                  artful in his disposal of the various lords of the provinces. Families attached
                  personally to him were stationed in provinces lying between those administered by
                  families friendly to the Emperor. Thus none of the Emperor’s friends could meet to
                  revolt against the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>.</p>
               <pb n="21"/>
               <p>So it happened that while the Lord Catzu was one of the most intimate and
                  confidential of the advisers of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, his
                  neighbor, the old Prince Mori, <foreign xml:lang="ja">Daimio</foreign> of the
                  province of Choshui, desired to see the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign>
                  once more, the real, instead of the nominal, ruler of Japan.</p>
               <p>Consequently the two neighboring clans, while displaying extravagant courtesy
                  towards each other in public, were in reality unfriendly. Only during that portion
                  of the year when the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s edict ordered a
                  Yedo residence for all <foreign xml:lang="ja">daimios</foreign>, did the lords of
                  the provinces meet one another, and that under the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s eyes in his Yedo seat of government. In the capital they
                  simulated suavity and cordiality, but once back at their provincial capitals they
                  preserved towards each other an attitude of polite defiance which made all
                  intercourse between them impossible save that of the sword, when their respective
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> and vassals, coming in contact with
                  one another, fought out their lords’ political differences. </p>
               <p>Imbittering still more the feeling existing naturally between the Mori and Catzu
                  clans, there was a personal element in the situation. When Catzu had first been
                  made lord of the province he had met on a visit to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s Yedo court the Lady Evening Glory, whose brother and
                  guardian (she being an orphan) was a young <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> in the service of the <pb n="22"/> Prince Mori. Having
                  fallen a victim to the lady’s beauty and charms, the lord of Catzu was determined
                  to have her for wife despite the opposition of the Mori Prince. Bold, brave,
                  fearless, and with a grand contempt for the power of his rival, the Lord Catzu had
                  carried off the fair lady from his neighbor’s dominions, though it was generally
                  understood that both the lady herself and her <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> brought lent their assistance to the young lord. The young
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, incurring thereby the deep
                  displeasure and enmity of his Prince, was deprived of his title and estates and
                  sent into exile upon the first convenient pretext. Strange talks told without
                  shadow of authority diversified the nature of the crime for which the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> had been exiled, but the two lords remained
                  silent. All who had been concerned in the affair were commanded to the same
                  silence by the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>.</p>
               <p>Whatever were the many reasons responsible for the constant attitude of antagonism
                  of these two clans towards each other, the lords carefully guarded their
                  lands—more aces—with all the rigor of a fortress prepared for the fiercest
                  onslaught. Seemingly unapproachable and impenetrable as were the grounds of the
                  Catzu palace, yet there must have existed at some spot in their watchful walls a
                  vulnerable point, the heel of the stone Achilles. </p>
               <pb n="23"/>
               <p>A courtier, by his dress and demeanor plainly a member of the Mori household,
                  lingered in the private gardens of the palace. The day had long since folded its
                  wings of light, but an early March moon was enveloping the land in an ethereal
                  glow. The courtier remained under the friendly shadow of a grove of pine-trees.
                  His eyes were cast upon the stately Catzu <foreign xml:lang="ja">shiro</foreign>
                  (palace). It seemed as though the moon-rays had singled out the graceful old
                  castle and was bathing it tenderly in a halo of soft light.</p>
               <p>It was cold, not bitterly so, but sharply chill, as it is at night betwixt the
                  winter and the spring. But unconscious of the chill, erect and graceful, the
                  courtier leaned against a tree-trunk, ih sarms crossed over his breast, his eyes
                  full of moist sentiment, drinking in the beauty of the night scene, which had an
                  added enchantment for him, a man in love.</p>
               <p>All about him, before, behind, and around him, graceful pine-trees raised their
                  slender, pointed heads up to the silver light. In the distance, like a strange,
                  white mirage set in the moonlit sky, a snow-capped mountain seemed hung as in
                  mid-air. The grass beneath his feet was young and intensely soft, with dewy
                  moisture upon it.</p>
               <p> A nightingale on the tip of a tall bamboo sang with such passionate sweetness
                  that it brought the lover out from the shelter of the shadow. Quivering with
                  emotion, his<pb n="24"/>soul responding and vibrating to the song of love, he
                  strode into the light of the moon. Unmindful of the danger of his exposure to
                  possible observation, he drew forth from the bosom of his <foreign xml:lang="ja">haori</foreign> a little roll of rice-paper. Once more he read it through, and
                  yet once again. </p>
               <p><q>MY LORD,—I write this augustly insignificant letter to you, trusting that your

                     river. Mayhap you will hire a boat. Then do you come up this honorable river,
                     keeping close to the shore, and I do assure you that you will discover a break
                     in the south wall, which leads into the gardens surrounding the palace</q>.

                  <p>The nightingale paused in its song, and then broke out again, its long,

                  <p>The lover returned to the shelter of the pine grove, and, throwing himself upon
                     the grass, drew his cape close about him. Leaning his head upon his hand, he
                     gave himself up to his dreams. </p></div>

                  <p>The Lady Wistaria arose with the sun. without waiting to pin back the long,
                     silken hair which hung like a cloud of lacquer about her, she stole softly to
                     the casement of her chamber.</p>
                  <p>The perfume which stole up to her was sweeter and stronger far than that wafted
                     from the trees laden with the dews of the early morning. Yet the trees were
                     bare of blossoms and would not bloom for a month to come. Nevertheless the
                     ledge of Wistaria’s casement was piled with the living spring blossoms <pb n="27"/> of plum and cherry. She could not but caress them with her hands,
                     her lips, her eyes, her burning cheeks. With little, trembling hands she
                     searched among them and found what she sought—a scroll—a narrow, thin,
                     wonderful scroll, long, yet only a few inches in width, with golden borders
                     down the sides, and the faint, exquisite tracings of birds and flowers
                     intertwined among the words that leaped up at her almost as though they had
                     spoken. It was a poem to her—her grace, beauty, modesty, loveliness, its
                     theme:</p>

                           <l>From tiny feet to golden comb,</l>

                        <lg type="stanza">
                           <l>Oh, lovely maid, my moon thou art;</l>
                           <l>O Fuji san, thou hast my heart!</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>There were many other verses, but the Lady Wistaria was too much moved to have
                     either the vision or the mind to read beyond the first stanza. As became her
                     rank and the painful tuition of years, she should have pushed very deliberately
                     the flowers from her sill and torn the scroll into ragged pieces, a
                     chastisement prescribed by every etiquette for the temerity of a presumptuous
                     lover. </p>
                  <p>But the Lady Wistaria did nothing of the sort. She gathered the flowers
                     tenderly and took them in. Then she came back to the <pb n="28"/> casement,
                     and, learning far out, gazed with piercing wistfulness out into the little
                     garden below. For some minutes she waited, the patience of her caste fading
                     away gradually into that of the impatience of her sex.</p>
                  <p>A voice beneath her casement! She leaned farther over. A young man’s eager,
                     glowing face smiled up at her like the rising sun. Again the Lady Wistaria
                     forgot the training of years. Her trembling voice floated down to him:</p>
                  <p><q>Pray you do consider the perils in which you place yourself</q>, she
                     implored.</p>
                  <p><q>I would pass through all the perils of hell so I might reach you in the
                        end</q>, he fervidly whispered back. </p>
                  <p><q>Oh, my lord, look yonder! See, the sun is pushing its way upward above the
                        mountains and the hill-tops. Do you not know that soon my uncle’s guards
                        will pass this way?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p><q>Under the heavens there is nothing in all this wide world worthy as a gift
                        for you, dear lady. That you have deigned to accept my honorable flowers and
                        my abominably constructed poem has given me such strength that I am prepared
                        to fight a whole army of guards. Ay! And to give up readily, too, my
                        life</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>And if you love me</q>, she replied, <q>you will guard with all your
                        strength that life which you are so recklessly exposing to danger</q>.</p>
                  <pb n="29"/>
                  <p><q>Ah, sweetest lady, can it be true then that you condescend to take some
                        concern in my insignificant existence?</q></p>
                  <p>She made no response other than to pluck from the climbing wine about her
                     casement one little half-brown leaf and drop it at his feet.</p>
                  <p>As he stooped to pick up the leaf a form interposed itself, and a half-grown
                     man looked him steadily in the face. With a little cry the Lady Wistaria
                     vanished from her casement.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile the intruder, instead of being the aggressor, was defending himself
                     against the flashing blade of the infuriated lover. Too proud to call for aid,
                     the youth opposed to the lover found himself outmatched before the skill and
                     fire of the other. So thinking caution better than valor, he flung his sword at
                     the feet of the lover. The latter, picking it up by the middle, returned it to
                     his opponent with a low bow of utmost grace. Then with one hand on his hip and
                     the othr holding his sword, he addressed the youth.</p>
                  <p><q>Thy name?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Catzu Toro. And thine?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Too insignificant to be spoken before one who bears so great a name as
                        thine</q>, returned the other, bowing with satirical grace.</p>
                  <p><q>How is that?</q> cried Catzu Toro— <q>insignificant? What, one in thy garb
                        and with thy skill of swordsmanship?</q></p>
                  <pb n="30"/>
                  <p>The victorious one, shrugging his shoulders imperceptibly, again bowed with a
                     smile of disclaimer. </p>
                  <p><q>May I be permitted</q>, he said, <q>to put one question to you, my lord, and
                        then I am perfectly prepared to give myself up to your father’s guards,
                        though not, I promise you, without a struggle, which I doubt not your
                        vassals will long remember</q>. And her blithely bent the blade of his sword
                     with his two hands.</p>
                  <p><q>Nay, then</q>, cried the youth, impetuously, <q>You do me injustice. I am
                        ready to swear protection to one who has acted so bravely as thou. But a
                        question for a question, is not that fair?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Assuredly</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Very well, then. You serve the Prince of Mori?</q></p>
                  <p><q>In a very humble capacity</q>, returned the other, guardedly.</p>
                  <p><q>In what capacity?</q> inquired the young Toro, quickly.</p>
                  <p><q>Ah, that is two questions, and you have not even deigned to listen to my
                        one</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Speak</q>, said the youth, curbing his curiosity and impatience.</p>
                  <p><q>The Lady Wistaria—she is your sister?</q></p>
                  <p><q>My cousin</q>, answered the other, briefly. </p>
                  <p><q>Will you tell me how it is possible for one unfortunately attached to an
                        unfriendly clan to pay court to your cousin?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Two questions, that!</q> exclaimed Toro, <pb n="31"/> promptly, whereat they
                     both laughed, their friendship growing in proportion to their good-humor.</p>
                  <p><q>Now</q>, said Toro, <q>I will answer whatever questions you may put to me,
                        if you in return will only satisfy my mind concerning certain matters which
                        I am perishing to know</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>A fair exchange! Good!</q></p>
                  <p><q>Then</q>, said Toro, unloosening his own cape from his hips, <q>pray throw
                        this about you, for I fear you will be observed by my father’s samurai. Even
                        my presence</q>, he added, with a sigh, <q>could hardly protect you, for I,
                        alas! am under age</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Is it possible?</q> said the stranger, with such affected surprise that the
                     boy flushed with delight.</p>
                  <p><q>Now, my lord</q>—he hesitated, doubtfully, as though hoping the other would
                     supply the name—<q>now, my lord, let me explain to you why I truly sympathize
                        with you in your love for one who must seem impossible</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Not impossible</q>, corrected the lover, softly, thinking tenderly of the
                     Lady Wistaria’s fears for him.</p>
                  <p><q>I, too</q>, confessed Toro, <q>am in the same plight</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>What!</q> cried the lover, in dismay; <q>you also adore the lady?</q></p>
                  <p><q>No</q>, replied Toro, shaking his head with sad melancholy; <q>but I have
                        conceived the <pb n="32"/>most hopeless attachment for a lady whom I may
                        never dream of winning</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then I am much mistaken in you. I thought, my lord, that you were not only a
                        brave man, but a daring knight</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>But you cannot conceive of the extremity of my case</q>, cried the youth,
                     piteously, <q>for consider: the lady I love not only belongs to our rival clan,
                        but is already betrothed</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Well, but betrothals have been broken before, my lord, and the days of
                        romance and adventure are not altogether dead in the land</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Ah, yes, that is true, but my rival is not only more powerful, but in every
                        respect more prepossessing and attractive</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Indeed? Well, all this interests me very much. Still, I must say, my lord,
                        that though I am in the service of the Mori, I have not seen the knight or
                        courtier who could probe so formidable a rival to you, either in graces or
                        rank—for are you not the son of the great lord of this province?</q></p>
                  <p><q>And has not our neighboring lord a son also?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Wh—what!</q> cried the stranger, darting backward as though the youth had
                     dealt him a sharp and unexpected blow; then scanning the other’s face closely,
                        <q>You do not mean—the Prince--?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Yes—the Prince Keiki. That swaggering, bragging, noisy roustabout, who bears
                        so many cognomens</q>. </p>
                  <pb n="33"/>
                  <p><q>Hum!</q> said the other. <q>They call him the Prince Kei—, truly—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p><q>Yes</q>, said the youth, jealously, <q>and also ‘<foreign xml:lang="ja">Hikal – Keiki – no – Kimi</foreign>’ (the Shining Prince Keiki)</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>You have told me strange news indeed</q>, said the Mori courtier. <q>I did
                        not know of the betrothal of our Prince. It is very sad, truly</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Sad! To be betrothed to the Princess Hollyhock sad?</q></p>
                  <p><q>For you, my lord</q>, replied the other, with a slight smile.</p>
                  <p>Toro doubled his hands spasmodically as he frowned with the fierceness of a
                        <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, that the other might not observe
                     the soft moisture of a woman in his eyes.</p>
                  <p><q>Now let me tell you a secret</q>, said the stranger, touching his arm with
                     confidential sympathy. <q>Upon my word, the Princess Hollyhock is not betrothed
                        to the Prince Keiki</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>My lord, you do not say so! Are you sure?</q></p>
                  <p><q>As sure as I am that I am here now</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Oh, the gods themselves must have sent you hither!</q> cried the youth.
                        <q>Will you not accept my protection and constant aid in your suit for my
                        cousin?</q></p>
                  <p><q>You are more generous than—</q></p>
                  <p><q>Your Prince, you would say</q>, interrupted Toro, bitterly. </p>
                  <pb n="34"/>
                  <p><q>—than the gods, I was about to remark</q>, said the other, gravely. <q>Now
                        let us form a compact. You on your side with promise me protection and aid
                        here on your estates, and I will swear to you that you shall win and wed the
                        Princess Hollyhock</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>I have a small house yonder, my lord</q>, cried the impulsive youth,
                     excitedly. <q>It is kept by my old nurse. Come you with me thither. I shall
                        lend you whatever clothes you may require and you shall remain here as long
                        as you wish. I will introduce you to my family as a friend—a student from my
                        own university in Kummommotta. Then you can make suit to Wistaria, and,
                        having oce wed her, who can separate you, let me ask?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Not the gods themselves, I swear!</q> cried the other. </p>
                  <p><q>And your name—what shall I call you?</q></p>
                  <p>The courtier hesitated for the first time.</p>
                  <p><q>My name is insignificant. It is a Mori name, and therefore dangerous in your
                        province</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>You must assume another, then</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Hum! Well, what would you suggest, my lord?</q></p>
                  <p><q>How will Shioshio Shawtaro do?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Not at all. It has a trading sound</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Ho! ho! How about Taketomi Tokioshi?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Too imperious</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Fujita Gemba?</q></p>
                  <pb n="35"/>
                  <p><q>No, no</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then do you choose yourself</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>My lord, waiving aside all our political differences, do you not think it
                        would be loyal for me to take the name of one of my own people?</q></p>
                  <p><q>What, a Mori name? you are very droll, my lord. Why not keep your own name,
                        then?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Ah, but it is not the Mori family name I wish to assume, but a
                     surname</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>It might be dangerous</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Oh, not without the family name and title attached. Suppose I take the name
                        of Keiki?</q></p>
                  <p><q>What! The name of my rival!</q></p>
                  <p><q>My prince, my lord</q>, said the other, bowing deeply. </p>
                  <p><q>Nevertheless my rival</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Not at all; and if he were so, why not grant him this little honor, seeing
                        you are to worst him in the suit for the lady?</q></p>
                  <p><q>That is true</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>The name will sound vastly different with another family name attached.
                        Suppose I assume the name of Tominaga Keiki? That is somewhat different from
                        Mori Keiki, is it not?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Somewhat</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then Keiki is my name</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Kei— Very well. Let it be so</q>.</p>

                  <head>V</head>
                  <p>The Lord of Catzu received his son’s friend with hospitality dictated by his
                     fat and good-humored nature, beseeching him to consider the Catzu possessions
                     as his own. Keiki (as he had called himself), on fire to make use of the
                     advantage he had now gained at the outset, was met by two unexpected
                     obstacles.</p>
                  <p>In the first place, the Lady Wistaria was hedged about by an almost
                     insurmountable wall of etiquette and form. Though the lover blessed all the
                     gods for the privilege of being in <pb n="37"/> her presence each day, yet,
                     impetuous, warm-blooded, and ardent, he could not but chafe at the distance and
                     the silence which seemed impassable between them. </p>
                  <p>Wisteria, he thought, might just as well have been a twinkling star in the
                     heavens above him as to be placed at one end of the guest room, her lips sealed
                     in maidenly silence, while at the other end, in the place of honor, must sit
                     he, the august guest, inwardly the burning lover. Between them interposed her
                     honorable relatives and certain members of her uncle’s household, separating
                     the lovers with their extravagant politeness and words of gracious compliment
                     and hospitability. </p>
                  <p>In the second place, the pilot upon whom he had relied for safe conduct through
                     the icy forms which kept him from his mistress had deserted him perfidiously.
                     Toro, the reckless and foolhardy, his imagination fed by the daring and
                     sang-froid of the Mori clansman, his own heart aflame with as deep a passion as
                     his friend’s, had borrowed his dress and departed for Choshui, there to risk
                     all chance of danger with the bravery, but without, alas! the wit, of the Mori
                     courtier. </p>
                  <p>To offset these two hardships, the lovers saw a gift sent by the gods in the
                     indisposition of the Lady Evening Glory. After the long and tedious journey
                     from the capital, the lady, who was of a delicate constitution, retired to her
                     apartments with a malady of the <pb n="38"/>head and tooth. In point of fact,
                     the Lady Evening Glory suffered from neuralgia. The lovers prayed that her
                     illness might be long and lingering, though Wistaria, having besought her to
                     keep to her bed as long as possible that relapse might be avoided, tempered her
                     prayer with a petition to her favorite god that her aunt’s illness might be
                     unattended with pain.</p>
                  <p>With the Lady Evening Glory, the vigilant mentor of Wistaria, safely out of the
                     way, the girl found no cause for despair. This was the reason she returned her
                     lover’s pleading and ofttimes reproachful glances with smiles, which, but for
                     the joy of seeing them, he would have thought heartless. The joy of Wistaria’s
                     smile almost compensated for the pain of her lover’s poignant surmise that her
                     heart had no pity for the woes of her adorer. </p>
                  <p>And, indeed, at this time there was little else in the girl’s heart save a
                     singing joy, a rippling flutter of new emotions and thrills, which she, too
                     innocent as yet to recognize their full import, cared only to welcome with
                     delight, to encourage, to foster and enjoy to the uttermost.</p>
                  <p>Between Wistaria and her uncle there was utmost confidence and love. The young
                     girl occupied that place in his heart which would have been held by the
                     daughter denied him by the gods. The mantling flush, the ever-shining eyes, now
                     bright with joy that would <pb n="39"/> overflow, now moist with the unbidden
                     tears that spring to the eyes when the heart is disturbed with an emotion more
                     sweet than expression; these—the change which young love alone can produce in a
                     maiden—he was quick to perceive. </p>
                  <p>The Lord Catzu’s own marriage had been most romantic, and if his lady had lived
                     down frigidly to the world, her husband at least had retained his sentimental
                     remembrance of the adventurous escapades attending it. </p>
                  <p>Such were the opportunities of life to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">daimio</foreign> of a province at peace that, to all outward appearances,
                     Catzu was too indolent, too listlessly, luxuriously lazy and preoccupied with
                     his own pleasures to observe his niece’s condition of heart. But the Lord
                     Catzu, with all his placidity, was astute. Beneath his lazy eyelids his own
                     small eyes missed little that passed before him.</p>
                  <p>In fact, it was not long before he became aware of the attachment between the
                     young people. The courtier, he knew, bore an assumed name, for Toro had labored
                     with awkwardness when he endeavored to invent a lineage for the friend whose
                     appearance at the Catzu palace without the customary retinue of servants or
                     retainers had convinced its lord that he had discovered a tinge of that
                     delightful mystery which but added to the favor of the unknown in the eyes of
                     the sentimental Lord of Catzu. In addition, it was <pb n="40"/> the mode for
                     young nobles of the realm to undertake courtship over an assumed name, so that
                     an air of romance might be lento their love affair. As to the young man’s rank
                     there could be no question, since his manners and breeding, his grace of person
                     and charm of speech, were caste characteristic. Looking secretly with high
                     favor upon the young man, Caztu considered how he might aid the lovers. </p>
                  <p>Slothful and deliberate in all he undertook, Catzu might provoke impatience,
                     but his gradual accomplishment of his ends was gratifying. Just as he took his
                     time in the serious business of life, so was he leisurely in the pursuit of his
                     pleasures. As a consequence the lovers for a time were kept in an agony of
                     waiting and suspense.</p>
                  <p>Keiki, maddened and irritated by the constant presence of the smiling Lord
                     Catzu, who in his opinion stood between him and his heart’s desire, once more
                     fell to writing imploring letters and poems to the Lady Wistaria which made up
                     in epithets of endearment what they lacked in rhetoric. He prayed her to find
                     some means by which he might be with her alone, if only for a fraction of a
                     minute. The one word <q>Patience</q>, written upon a little china plate, so
                     minutely that he could scarcely decipher it, was the reply brought by the Lord
                     Catzu, with the information that the Lady Wistaria her-<pb n="41"/>self had
                     painted the plate for their august guest.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile Catzu, cognizant of every sigh, every appealing expression, every
                     significant motion, laid his plans carefully for the impatient suitor’s
                     happiness. Certainly within the walls of the palace itself there was no hope of
                     solitude for the lovers. Pretexts for out-door pleasure-parties were never
                     wanting in the warmer season. Local fêtes, the birth of each new flower, family
                     events—all these were sufficient invitation in themselves for such convivial
                     parties as delighted the soul of the lord of Catzu, and could not have failed
                     in their chance opportunity for dual solitude.</p>
                  <p>At this time of the year, alas! there was neither snow nor moon nor flowers to
                     serve a pretext. A series of heavy rainfalls, most distressing and persistent,
                     was the only fugitive before approaching spring. Yet even the rain-gods have a
                     limit to their tears, and, after all, the rains preceding the first month of
                     spring are ofttimes the very means by which the land is cleansed ere it bursts
                     into beauty and bud.</p>
                  <p>Not so interminable as it seemed to them was the lovers’ waiting. Three short
                     days—yet how long!—and then the sun which had struggled for ascendency over the
                     troubled heavens rose up proudly triumphant. The thunders retreated into
                     tremulous growls of defeat; the gray-black clouds rolled away <pb n="42"/>before the blinding flashes of the sun-rays, flitting like ghosts before the
                     dawn. An immense rainbow, spanning the entire heavens, sprang out of the skies,
                     a signal of the sun-god’s victory. </p>
                  <p>What mattered it that the land was barren as yet of flowers? The grass was
                     green and the trees almost bursting in effort of emulation. Catzu, having
                     satisfied himself that the moisture on the grass was but the dew of spring,
                     forthwith devised a small party. it consisted of his lady niece and the august
                     guest of the household, who was graciously entreated to accompany them, and who
                     accepted with an alacrity almost lacking courtesy. </p>
                  <p>With but two attendants, the party set out from the palace. Taking a small
                     boat, they made a swift pilgrimage up the graceful river to a small island
                     where a picturesque tea-house and gardens, with twenty charming <foreign xml:lang="ja">geishas</foreign>, made a fairyland for lovers. </p>
                  <p>To receive so early and unheralded a visit from the august lord of the province
                     threw the <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign> into a delighted panic of
                     excitement. Their attendants were seen rushing hither and thither throughout
                     the place, hastily making it suitable for the reception of the exalted
                     guests.</p>
                  <p>Hastening down to the beach, the chief <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign> herself apologized for the
                     island’s condition. The Lord of Catzu went to meet her. For his guest to be
                     received without <pb n="43"/>preparation, he explained to Keiki, would be
                     unfitting. Consequently he begged him to remain on the beach, while he himself
                     proceeded with the chief <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign> to the tea-house to issue instruction. </p>
                  <p>The stolid and indifferent lackeys who had attended the party returned to the
                     boat, where they fell into conversation with the oarsmen. </p>
                  <p>At last the lovers were alone.</p>
                  <p>For a long moment Keiki and Wistaria looked into each other’s eyes. They were
                     safe from all observation, for the gardens, and indeed the whole island, was of
                     that rock-and-pebble-built variety favored by the Japanese. Behind and around
                     them they were screened by quaint, grotesque rocks of natural form and immense
                     size, carried from a mountain to this tiny island, placed there in miniature to
                     simulate nature.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheless Keiki, the impatient and ardent, now at the crucial moment, had
                     naught to say. He had confessed his love in his letters; she had admitted
                     tacitly her own. Still they did not embrace, or even touch each other. Culture
                     is strong in Japan, where also is the fire of love. So these two but looked
                     into each other’s faces, all their hearts’ eloquent passion in their eyes.
                     Wistaria’s eyes did not fall before his tender gaze. Only a rose-red flush
                     crept softly like a magic glow over the oval of her cheeks, tingeing <pb n="44"/>her little chin while accentuating her brow’s whiteness.</p>
                  <p>Without a word her lover dropped upon one knee, lifted the long sleeve of her
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign>, and buried his face within its fabric. </p>
                  <p>Five minutes later, hand in hand, they were standing on the same spot. They
                     were watching the river, swollen by recent rains, as it burst over the rocks
                     beyond, bounding down the river-bed, rolling swiftly along, twisting, curving,
                     and winding about the sinuous form of the island’s shore, holding it in the
                     grudging love of the water for the land. The water was blue-green in color,
                     save where the sunbeams reflected its own light in glistening gleams of
                     quicksilver, ever moving, ever playing, while the shores on either side threw
                     shadows of their trees and rocks upon it. As it ran busily, merrily along, now
                     and then lapping the shore and leaping to their very feet, it seemed a living
                     thing which babbled and laughed with an inward knowledge of their joy, and also
                     sighed and wailed with a prophetic undercurrent of coming woe.</p>
                  <p>The touch of their hands close clasped together made them tremble and quiver.
                     Their eyes met to droop away and meet again in the vivid recognition of their
                     own innocent happiness. They could not speak, because their hearts had laid
                     claim to their lips and sealed them in a golden silence. </p>
                  <pb n="45"/>
          
               <p>Then, after a long interval, Keiki found his voice. If he spoke of the flowing
                  river at their feet, it was not the river itself that absorbed his mind, but
                  because in it, as in all things beautiful in life, he now saw reflected the image
                  of his beloved.</p>
               <p><q>The honorable river</q>, he said, <q>flow high at this season, but before the summer
                  dies it will be but a thin line, very still, very quiet</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Yes</q>, said Wistaria, tremulously, <q>but the lotus will spring up in its honorable
                  waters, and if the river should continue to rise and rush onward like this, I fear
                  me the water-flowers would perish and the noise of its ceaseless flow would drown
                  the voices of the birds, which make the summer speak</q>.</p>
               <p><q>That is true</q>, said Keiki, <q>but when the summer passes then the flowers must
                  still die, and we may no longer hear the singing of the birds. Then still the
                  river will be silent and motionless—perhaps dead</q>.</p>
               <p>Keiki signed with the moodiness of love attained. A gentle depression stole from
                  him to the Lady Wistaria.</p>
               <p><q>Alas! my lord</q>, she murmured; <q>it is so with all things in life that are
                  beautiful. They vanish and die like the flowers of summer</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Then</q>, said Keiki, <q>swear by the god of the sea, by whose waters we now stand,
                  that our love shall never die, and that for the time of this life, and the next,
                  and as <pb n="46"/>many after as may come, you will be my flower wife, and take me for
                  your husband</q>.</p>
               <p><q>By all the eight million gods of heaven, and by the god of the sea, I swear</q>,
                  said Wistaria. </p>

                  <head>VI</head>
                  <p>The air was balmy, the sky of a cerulean blue, the Dewdrop gardens were sweet
                     with a strange charm and mystery all their own. Pebbles, sand, and stone, were
                     cunningly displayed and mingled to create the illusion of an approach to a
                     giant sea. In themselves the wonderous rocks were so fashioned as to form a
                     landscape wherein neither foliage, trees, nor flowers were necessary. Small,
                     grotesque bridges, made of rare rocks in their natural form, undefeated by
                     hammer or chisel, spanned the miniature <pb n="48"/> 
                  rivers, which, snakelike, crept and threaded their way in and out of the rock
                     island. Suddenly appearing caverns yawed wide agape, only to show on closer
                     approach that they were naught but gigantic rocks, hollow within. </p>
                  <p>Though the gardens were bare of foliage, yet the spot shone out like a jewel
                     set in a magic river. Here was the perfection of art, that art so complete that
                     without the very things of nature which seem necessary to a landscape, the
                     cunning hand of man had fashioned the like out of the hard and jagged substance
                     of stone and rock. And in this the hand of the Creator had aided, since the
                     very rocks which formed this precious and priceless island, the pride and
                     wealth of the lord of Catzu, had been untouched by the tool of the artisan,
                     for, having been gathered together from all parts of the country, they were
                     planted in their natural form upon this island jewel.</p>
                  <p>Across the narrow river the shores were green, while beyond the silent surface
                     of the moats the granite walls of the Catzu palace rose to a height, white and
                     stately, tipped with golden towers and peaks that were taller than the cedars
                     and the pines centuries old. </p>
                  <p>A stir of expectation thrilled the Dewdrop tea-house, and then a clear, shrill
                     voice cried aloud:</p>
                  <p><q>The Lady Wistaria passes into the honorable hall</q>.</p>
                 <pb n="49"/>
                  <p>The twenty <foreign xml:lang="ja">geishas</foreign> prostrated themselves at my lady’s feet. Gracefully she
                     returned their courtesy, begging that they would serve her and her august
                     guest, the Lord Tominaga Keiki, with refreshment.</p>
                  <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">geishas</foreign>, at this period in history occupying a high and dignified position
                     in society, expressed their wish to serve their lady for the rest of their
                     lives.</p>
                  <p>They brough the lovers fresh fruit, shining and luscious, and drink from a well
                     of sweetest and purest water. Humbly apologizing for the honorable meanness of
                     the refreshment, the chief <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign> prayed that they would condescend to pardon
                     her, for not even in her dreams had she imagined that the gods would favor her
                     so soon in the season with such august guests.</p>
                  <p>But the lovers only smiled benevolently upon her, and insisted that never, no,
                     never in all the honorable days of their lives, had they been blessed with more
                     gracious refreshment. Whereat the <foreign xml:lang="ja">geisha</foreign>, with many low, grateful obeisances,
                     retired. </p>
                  <p>The lovers signed as in one breath.</p>
                  <p><q>Once more alone</q>, said Keiki, blissfully reaching over the little table
                     and laying his own hands softly upon those of the girl. <q>How gracious the
                        gods!</q></p>
                  <p><q>Of a truth</q>, said Wistaria, smiling up at him; <q>we must repay the
                        gods</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>We must, indeed. What shall we do? <pb n="50"/> Build a thousand temples
                        to—well, which one?</q></p>
                  <p><q>I consider!</q> quoth Wistaria, thinking very seriously. Then, suddenly,
                     with a little, silvery laugh: <q>I have it. Let us deify my own august uncle.
                        Is he not the god who befriends us?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Not consciously</q>, said Keiki, <q>for I doubt not my Lord of Catzu would
                        fume and curse me roundly did he know I took advantage of his honorable
                        disposition to sleep</q>.</p>
                  <p>Wistaria laughed softly.</p>
                  <p><q>Now I am quite ready to swear</q>, she said, <q>that of late my honorable
                        uncle is perfectly conscious when he sleeps</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Pray tell me</q>, cried Keiki, starting.</p>
                  <p>The girl nodded merrily.</p>
                  <p><q>Will you tell me, then, how it is possible for one to fall asleep in a
                        small, rocking boat? Could you or I do so, my Lord Keiki?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Oh, not you or I; but your honorable uncle is divinely lethargic</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then, my lord, he is but lately afflicted</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>But I do not understand, then—you cannot mean—Oh no, it could hardly be
                        so!</q></p>
                  <p><q>And why not, my lord? To me it seems that even the gods must needs favor
                        you, much more than an honorable mortal</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Your uncle favor me! It cannot be possible</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>It is possible. It is so</q>.</p>
                  <pb n="51"/>
                  <p><q>But he has been acquainted with me only for the past six days</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>And does it take a year for favor to grow, when love—</q>
                  </p>
                  <p><q>Awakens in a day—an hour</q>, finished Keiki, rapturously. <q>No, I can see
                        how it is possible, but I could not at once realize my good-fortune.
                        Moreover—</q></p>
                  <p>Suddenly he broke off as a melancholy shadow crept across his brow, troubling
                     his eyes. In a sudden depression he bent forward.</p>
                  <p><q>My lord is trouble? Speak to me quickly</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Troubled? Yes, that is so</q>, Keiki sighed.</p>
                  <p><q>Then do, I pray you, speak your trouble to me</q>, said Wistaria.
                     Immediately she threw herself at his feet, resting her hands upon his knees and
                     raising her face upward to his. Keiki took her face in his hands. He looked
                     deep into her love-lit eyes.</p>
                  <p><q>Yes, I will tell you, little Wistaria</q>, he said, <q>though I fear you are
                        already acquainted with my secret</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>I am not, indeed</q>, she denied.</p>
                  <p><q>You do not know</q>, he asked, sadly, <q>that I am of the Mori clan?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Of the Mori clan! And is that all that troubles you, my lord?</q></p>
                  <p><q>And is not that sufficiently serious?</q></p>
                  <p><q>No</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>But surely you must be aware of the feud existing between the Mori and Catzu
                        clans?</q></p>
                  <pb n="52"/>
                  <p><q>My lord, you and I do not constitute the Mori and Catzu clans</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>You and I</q>, he repeated, slowly, <q>do not constitute the Mori and Catzu
                        clans</q>. Then, after a silent moment: <q>Alas, my lady, I fear we
                     do!</q></p>
                  <p>Wisteria snatched her hands quickly from his and arose. Certainly he could not
                     love her, she thought, if he allowed so small a thing as that to distress
                     him.</p>
                  <p><q>If that be so—if that is what you think, my lord, deign to inform me why you
                        have condescended to make suit to me?</q></p>
                  <p><q>I was forced to make my suit in secret</q>, he said, almost bitterly.</p>
                  <p><q>But your love is honest, is it not?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Oh, my glower-girl, can you ask that?</q></p>
                  <p>She was contrite in a moment. Once more she was at his feet, kneeling, and
                     pressing both his hands with her little, slender, nervous fingers.</p>
                  <p><q>Nay, then, do no look so sad, my Keiki. It troubles me that you should allow
                        so silly a thing as the differences of our respective clans even for a
                        fraction of a moment to come between us</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>They cannot truly come between us</q>, was his fervid reply, <q>for no power
                        on earth can actually separate us now. are we not sworn to each other for
                        all time—for all eternity?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Then why be so sad? You, who are so <pb n="53"/>brave, cannot fear the dangers
                        that may beset our union</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>No, no, it is not that. But—I sigh for the tears of others—our honorable
                        ancestors and parents</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then do cease to sign at once, if you please. Why, it is not such a terrible
                     crime to marry a Mori, surely!</q></p>
                  <p><q>No, I hope not</q>, said Keiki, smiling now. </p>
                  <p><q>No, indeed, for my own honorable uncle committed that same fault</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Fault?</q></p>
                  <p><q>And I believe that if we were to go to him, and tell him the honorable
                        truth, he would gladly assist us</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Not if he knew all</q>, said Keiki, sadly. <q>No, he must know nothing
                        yet</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Indeed</q>, said Wistaria, <q>I did not know the feeling of the mori was so
                        bitter against us, and I do assure you that in Catzu the prejudice exists
                        not so much against your clan, as against your lord and prince</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Alas, that is too true!</q> answered Keiki, half under his breath.</p>
                  <p><q>Well, a courtier’s loyalty to his Prince need not at all be shaken if he
                        marry the insignificant niece of a rival clan, my own honorable father was
                        of that very clan himself. Know you not that, my lord?</q></p>
                  <p>Keiki groaned suddenly. Whereat the girl placed her hands on his shoulders and
                     forced him to look into her eyes. </p>
                <pb n="54"/>
            
              
                  <p><q>My lord</q>, she said, <q>do you know aught of my father’s history?</q></p>
                  <p>Slowly Keiki drew himself up from her clinging hands. Placing one arm close
                     about her, he drew her to his breast.</p>
                  <p><q>Let us no longer talk of these distressful matters</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Nay, I have asked you a question. Do, I beseech you, answer me</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>What can I say?</q> His voice was very low.</p>
                  <p><q>Tell me of my father—pray tell me</q>, she implored, almost piteously.</p>
                  <p><q>Of your father? But surely I can tell you nothing that you do not already
                        know?</q></p>
                  <p><q>I know naught of my father, save that he was a Choshui samurai, and for some
                        honorable offence was banished by that wicked and cruel Prince of
                     Mori</q>.</p>
                  <p>Keiki was silent.</p>
                  <p><q>I have questioned every one about me—my uncle, his samurai, the very
                        servants about the castle—but none will make answer to me, whether from
                        ignorance or by command of those in authority over them, I know not. Do you,
                        then, my lover, answer me</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>My little flower-girl, I do not know the offence of your honorable father,
                        nor do I know why or wherefore he was sent into exile. I was but a child of
                        five when this penalty came upon him</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Then wherefore di you tremble and turn <pb n="55"/>away your eyes when I spoke
                        of my honorable parent?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Because I know that injury of some sort was wrought against your honorable
                        parent by my—by the Mori, and since then so implacable an enmity exists
                        between our families that nothing but blood alone can ever wipe away the
                        stain. Think, then, of the wrong I do your father in loving his own
                        daughter!</q></p>
                  <p><q>No, no—dear Keiki—it is no wrong, I do assure you. If there be a feud
                        existing between my father and the Mori Prince, truly you and I, who are
                        innocent, cannot be implicated in any way, and, indeed, it is not as if I
                        were about to wed one of the Mori family itself, but—</q></p>
                  <p><q>In that case</q>, he interrupted, quickly, <q>if I were indeed of this Mori
                        family, what then?</q></p>
                  <p>For a moment the girl recoiled, shrinking backward, and regarded him with
                     frightened, shocked eves.</p>
                  <p><q>That—would—be—impossible</q>, she said, and she shivered with
                     apprehension.</p>
                  <p><q>If it were possible?</q> said the lover, hoarsely.</p>
                  <p><q>It could not be</q>, she insisted, <q>for the Mori princes are proud and
                        ill-favored, while you—</q></p>
                  <p><q>While I?</q></p>
                  <p><q>—You are more beautiful than the sun-god</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  <pb n="56"/>
                  <p><q>But you have not answered me. Suppose it were—Prince Keiki, the heir of
                        Mori, who wooed you?</q></p>
                  <p><q>I cannot, my lord. Oh, the Prince is otherwise occupied than in wandering
                        with love</q>, replied Wistaria, smiling at the thought. <q>Why, he is the
                        head of a wicked party of Imperialists, I have ofttimes heard my uncle
                        declare, and is the most cunning and base fermenter of intrigue against our
                        august <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> in the whole empire. Indeed, he has no time or inclination for
                        dallying with love</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>But—if I were indeed he, what then?</q></p>
                  <p><q>Why, then—then</q>, said the girl, slowly rising, and regarding him with
                     shining eyes, <q>then still I would say, ‘Take me.’ What have we to do with the
                        quarrels of our ancestors, the wrongs or the rights of our honorable
                        parents? You and I are under the sheltering wings of the god of love. We
                        recognize no law of country, lord, or kindred. Let us go into the mountains
                        together and find refuge in a cottage where we can live and love in
                        peace</q>.</p>
                  <p><q>Oh, thou dear one!</q> he cried.</p>
                  <p><q>But why suggest such a horrible possibility?</q> she continued, tremulously.
                        <q>Thou art not that base and traitorous Prince? Thou art—</q></p>
                  <p><q>Thy love! That is all</q>, he said.</p>

                  <head>VII</head>
                  <p>In the joy and sunshine of Wistaria’s nature, which would have driven sadness
                     from the soul of a hermit, Keiki’s melancholy was evanescent. Her lover’s fears
                     at the mere possibility of their being forced apart were soon dissipated by
                     her.</p>
                  <p>A week passed—sped like so many minutes. The pale green of the spring grass was
                     deepening in hue and the trees were in leaf. The lovers lingered in the paths
                     that led down to the little boat-house, whence each day they sailed slowly down
                     the river to the <pb n="58"/>rock island. There in the lazy, drifting boat, the
                     drowsy Lord of Catzu dosed back against his padded seat, while the lovers
                     looked into each other’s eyes, or furtively pressed each other’s hands.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile their short hours of happiness were being slowly ticked off by the
                     god of love, at whose shrine they had offered the whole wealth of their hearts.
                     The days of their joy were numbered. That strange honey of bliss they sipped so
                     greedily was soon to be snatched from their lips.</p>
                  <p>The Lady Evening Glory was recovering slowly from her indisposition. Because
                     the lady herself had contracted a most wilful and romantic marriage, she was
                     perhaps the more suspicious of the culpability of others. She trusted neither
                     youth nor maid, but Wistaria bore the weight of her suspicions. </p>
                  <p>While gossip and idle chatter had stolen into the lady’s chamber concerning the
                     charms and grace of their whilom guest, Wistaria’s almost extravagant
                     solicitude for her set my lady at first to thinking, and then to acting. </p>
                  <p>The Lady Evening Glory was no believer in the worship of the sun. Nevertheless,
                     some garrulous maid having carried to her the innocent remark of her niece that
                     she enjoyed viewing the rising of the sun, a few mornings later found the Lady
                     Evening Glory not only arising before the sun, but wending her way through the
                     silent corridors <pb n="59"/>of the palace until she was before the chamber of the
                     Lady Wistaria. Without so much as a tap for admission, she softly pushed aside
                     the sliding <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign>. </p>
                  <p>With the keenest of lover’s ears, Wistaria heard the faint shir-r-r made by the
                     sliding doors. In the same instant down went her own shutter. So when the Lady
                     Evening Glory entered the chamber she found her niece sitting on the floor, her
                     back set stffly against her casement shutter, and a deep rosy coloring all over
                     her face. Her guilty eyes fell before the cold glare of her august aunt.</p>
                  <p>The next thing the Lady Evening Glory’s sharp eyes fell upon were the flowers.
                     They lay in a great, tumbled mass all about the Lady Wistaria. There was no
                     mistaking the meaning of those tell-tale blossoms. The Lady Evening Glory’s
                     lips became a thin, pursed line.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>The flowers? Whence came they?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>From the honorable garden</q>, answered Wistaria, trembling.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>There is no tree in all the garden with blossoms in full bloom. They are only commencing to bud, and will not blossom before the first of April</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>To this undeniable fact Wistaria made no response.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Answer when thou art spoken to</q>, prompted her aunt, sharply.</p>

                  <p><q>My lady—I do not know what to say</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Then you leave me to my own conjectures. You have a lover</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Oh, no, indeed!</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>What! Flowers fresh with the morning dew in your chamber, and you with you
                        hair unbound! Pray when did it become an honorable fashion for ladies of our
                        rank to venture out to purchase flowers before sunrise—and in such scanty
                        attire?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>My aunt, you are killing me</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Your health appears to me to be far from feeble</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>I am innocent of any wrong</q>, said Wistaria, with a flash of spirit.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Then you will not object to inform me who presented you with these flowers?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>An honorable gentleman</q>, said Wistaria.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Indeed! And what is this honorable gentleman’s name, may I ask?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Wistaria hesitated. Then a sudden idea came to her. She smiled mysteriously.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>But I do not know his name</q>, she said, which was quite true, as she was unaware of her lover’s true name.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>You do not know the name of your lover!</q> cried her aunt, incredulously.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Indeed, I wish I did</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Yet you accept his gift! You are entirely without shame, girl!</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Oh, lady! the flowers were so beautiful I could not resist them</q>.</p>
                  
                  <pb n="61"/>
                  
                  <p><q>Beautiful!</q> shrieked her aunt. <q>And because flowers are beautiful, is that an excuse for accepting the lover of some impudent adventurer?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Accepting the love!</q> repeated Wistaria, faltering.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Yes, indeed, and you need not pretend ignorance of my words. They are quite clear to you, I have no doubt</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>But—</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>You are well aware that by accepting the flowers you also accept his despicable love, and practically betroth yourself to this fellow. He shall be flogged for his impertinence</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Flogged!</q> cried Wistaria, becoming very pale.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Flogged, I repeat</q>, said her aunt, coldly.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Wistaria shivered with apprehension. She had not until now grasped the real seriousness of her position.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Your father</q>, continued the Lady Evening Glory, <q>shall be sent for this day. We shall see what those in authority over you think of your conduct</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>The aunt had but to mention the father to fill Wistaria with fear. She sprang to her feet and stood trembling among the scattered blossoms.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>I am guilty of no wrong, I do assure you, my lady aunt. But I arose to enjoy the sun’s awakening, and—and I did find these honorable flowers on my sill, and indeed they spoke <pb n="62"/>to me of—of the coming summer, and so many things, dear aunt, that I was fain to take them in</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Then do, pray, my little dove, inform me what you know concerning this presumptuous fellow who placed them on your sill</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Oh, my lady, he is indeed honorably noble</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Indeed!</q></p>
                  <p><q>I do assure you. He is—</q> she broke off, painfully debating in her mind the wisdom of confessing the truth to her aunt.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>He is—?</q> repeated her aunt.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Our own august guest</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Ah—ho! Then, if that is so, you spoke a lie just a moment since when you
                        said you did not know your lover’s name</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Wistaria attempted to speak, but broke off, faltering and stammering piteously.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>May I inquire, then</q>, continued her aunt, relentlessly, <q>whether you are unacquainted with the honorable name of our august guest?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Oh, my lady, I do believe that—that he assumed another—only—just for the innocent romance of wooing me under an assumed title</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>So! And pray how comes it, then, that my son’s honorable guest should also happen to be your lover? If in order to woo you he came hither under an assumed name, then <pb n="63"/>it would seem that you had some previous acquaintance with him?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>He followed our cortège from Yedo, madame</q>, confessed the unhappy
                     girl.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>What! You do not meant to tell me that he is that insolent Mori courtier of whom I heard only after my arrival home?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Wistaria pressed her hands tightly together. She seemed overcome. Then suddenly she raised her head with almost defiant bravery.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>He is of the Mori clan, madame</q>, she said.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>The Mori clan!</q> The lady’s voice rose shrilly. <q>How came he, then, to enter our grounds?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>He came, my lady, by the south river, where there is a break in the wall</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>But how could he know this? Answer me that at once</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>I—</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Will you deign to inform me whether you condescended so far as to answer the
                        love-letters of this young man, for I have no doubt he favored you with
                        many?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>I wrote only one insignificant reply</q>, said Wistaria.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>And what, pray, did you say in this reply?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>I implored him to follow us no farther. I besought him to give up the impossible exploit of entering our grounds, and, knowing what would be his fate if he attempted to <pb n="64"/>do so, I also informed him that if he must indeed enter, to do so by way of the south river, that a portion of our grounds ran down to this honorable river and was unprotected by the walls, which otherwise surrounded us on all sides</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>So it seems that you have betrayed to our enemy the weakness of our condition?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Not an enemy, lady! He is not, indeed</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>And may I ask how your redoubtable lover, having gained entrance to our grounds, also contrived to wedge his way into the palace and become a guest of our hospitality?</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Toro—</q> faltered Wistaria.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p>Her aunt’s face flamed.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Toro, he discovered him the first morning, and—and—they became friends at once</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>My son!</q></p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Oh, yes, madame, and on my two knees, I am prepared to beg you to show him mercy</q>.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                  <p><q>Keep your knees, my young lady, to beg mercy for yourself. You may have need of it ere long</q>, said her aunt, with chilling irony.</p>
               </div>

            <p>From the insinuations and threats of the Lady Evening Glory it might seem as if Wistaria’s lover were in imminent danger, and that the Catzu family might be expected to hasten instantly to cast him out from their province or have him imprisoned as a trespasser and imposter. But Japanese craft is more subtle. Besides, the right of judgment lay in the hands of the father of Wistaria, who was her natural and legal guardian. It was necessary, therefore, that the young man should, for the <pb n="66"/>time being, gather no suspicion of their discovery. Consequently the Catzu family redoubled their expression of good will and friendship for their guest, while the only one who could have warned him was placed where she was helpless to do so.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With excessive sweetness, the Lady Evening Glory informed the courtier that she had heard such good reports of him from her honorable husband that she had risen prematurely from her bed of sickness in order to greet him and assure him of her solicitation for his comfort and pleasure during his stay in Catzu.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>All these marks of friendship and compliment from the honorable lady of the house,
                  besides the increased cordiality of the Lord of Catzu, would have been very
                  delightful to the lover, but for the fact that almost coincident with the return
                  to health of her aunt it was announced that the Lady Wistaria was unable to leave
                  her apartments because of a sudden illness. The lover, therefore, in an agony of
                  apprehension for the health of his mistress, had no heart or ears for the words of
                  compliment pressed upon him by her family.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He spent his time roving restlessly about the grounds of the palace in the neighborhood of Wistaria’s casement, but the blinds were drawn tightly, morning, noon and night, and there was only the memory of the girl’s <pb n="67"/>exquisite face at the window to torture the lover.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The arrival of Shimadzu, the father of the Lady Wistaria, created no stir in the
                  Catzu palace. He came silently at night. If any of the servants or members of the
                  household knew of his presence they were dumb concerning the matter. The lover,
                  consequently, was wholly unaware of his coming.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Shimadzu was closeted for some hours with his sister and brother-in-law. The Lady
                  Evening Glory was bitter against her niece. Not merely the fact of the indelicate
                  and unconventional manner of the courtship, nor even the fact that the lover was a
                  member of their rival clan, and through his residence among them must have
                  acquired information concerning their province which would be of value to his
                  prince—not these things infuriated her so much as the thought that her son, the
                  pride and joy of her life, the heir of Catzu, had been led by this stranger into
                  an undertaking both perilous and shameful, the outcome of which was most
                  uncertain.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Lord of Catzu was milder and more lenient towards the guilty parties, possibly realizing in his inmost soul a measure of the responsibility. He endeavored to palliate their offense.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As for Shimadzu himself, he had not one word to say. He listened to the separate speeches of his sister and brother-in-law, <pb n="68"/>and when they had concluded he simply requested that his daughter be ordered into his presence at once.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wild-eyed and trembling, Wistaria was brought in. Gone from her face, pale and drawn with the intensity of her sufferings, was all the sun. During the three days preceding the arrival of her father she had been locked up alone in an interior room of the palace. No one had approached save her august aunt, who brought food with her own hands, and whose absolute silence inspired her with a great dread. She would speak no word, or even deign to look at the unhappy girl. Wistaria, rendered frantic by fears for her lover, had ofttimes thrown herself at her aunt’s feet, piteously beseeching that she would enlighten her as to the fate of her lover. But the Lady Evening Glory would shake her skirts icily and contemptuously from her grasp, to retire without a word of response.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Now Wistaria prostrated herself before the parent who had always inspired her with such incomprehensible fear. He motioned her to be seated though he himself remained standing. Mutely, mechanically, she obeyed him.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p>For a moment there was silence. The deep-set eyes of the father looked out at
                  the young girl, noting the piteous tremble of the hands, the small, bowed head,
                  the down-dropped <pb n="69"/>eyes which dared no meet his own, and all the other
                  evidences of her sufferings. Whatever the thoughts of the father, whether merciful
                  or cruel, his impassive face revealed not his inner feelings. In some strange way
                  this <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> seemed steeled against the pain of
                  the world itself. Suddenly he spoke, his hollow voice smiting with a shock the
                  frail, highly strung girl.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My daughter, had you a mother to love and guide you, you would not now be unhappy</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He paused to note the effect of his strange words—strange because of the lack of emotion and sympathy that should have accompanied them. Wistaria raised her head painfully, but she did not speak.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Therefore</q>, continued her father, <q>I wish to inform you that it is because of an enemy that you are now motherless, and therefore misguided</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>An enemy?</q> repeated Wistaria, dully.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And it is to take my revent upon this enemy that I am now about to impose a
                     certain duty upon you which may at first seem repugnant. Before I do so,
                     however, I wish to remind you that you come of a proud and heroic race, my
                     daughter, no member of which has ever faltered in his duty. I would therefore,
                     my daughter, much rather see you strong and fearless than weak and trembling,
                     as you now appear</q>.</p>
    
      <pb n="70"/>
    
            <p>Raising herself bravely, with a superhuman effort the girl grasped at her strength of will.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My weakness, honorable father, is but temporary. Speak your august will with me</q>, she said.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>That is well</q>, returned the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, briefly. <q>I have a few questions first of all to put to you. I need not say that I expect truthful answers, and will tolerate no prevarication</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The girl bowed her head with a certain dignity of submissiveness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Of what rank is your lover?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria trembled.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not know</q>, she replied, in a low voice.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He has not mentioned his rank to you?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Only that he was of honorably insignificant rank</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Humph! Well, that is but a natural reply. What is his appearance?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>For a brief moment a gleam of strange pride came over her face. She pressed her little hands passionately together.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, my father, he is honorably noble, I do assure you. He possesses—</q></p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>I did not ask for a rhapsody upon his merits</q>, interrupted the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, coldly. <q>However, I am satisfied as to his rank</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A tear fell softly upon her little hand. Feeling, rather than seeing, her father’s irritation, she brushed it away impatiently, trying vainly to appear brave.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Now</q>, resumed Shimadzu, half to himself, <pb n="71"/><q>if he is of noble rank it follows that he is close to the Mori family. Very good</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He turned to his daughter.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He is a good Imperialist?</q></p>
            <p><q>He is honorably loyal</q>, she replied.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Loyal to his prince, you mean, or his party?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Surely to both. He could not be otherwise. He is a brave and true gentleman, my father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well, I have no more questions to ask you. I shall now outline to you the duty I have prepared for you. You are ready to obey my will?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>In all things, honored parent</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is well. I commend you for your filial words. First of all, I desire all possible information concerning the young heir of Mori</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But—</q> she faltered, <q>how is it possible for me—?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your lover</q>, said her father, quickly, <q>is a Mori courtier. There is no doubt he will give you all the information I require</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, then, my father</q>, she cried, clasping her hands together, <q>you will be lenient towards him, will you not? You will permit him to see me?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have nothing against your lover</q>, said her father, with slight irritation.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, father!</q> In a moment her face was aglow with hope and happiness.</p><pb n="72"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I advise you to listen to me</q>, he rejoined, coldly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak! Speak, august father! I will follow your commands faithfully, joyfully</q>.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>I wish to know the nature of this prince, his habits, his mode of life, and
                     the esteem in which he is held by his people. Once you have learned these
                     facts, you must secure for me specific details concerning his political schemes
                     against the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign></q>.</p>
            <p>Gradually Wistaria had rise to her feet. She had grown strangely pale. Her eyes were frightened and apprehensive.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You desire</q>, she repeated, slowly, as though she scarce comprehended the words—<q>you desire to know the secrets of—of his honorable party?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Exactly</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You desire</q>, she began to repeat, <q>to know the secrets—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>More than that</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>More. You—you—my father, you would not injure his—his party?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your apprehension, my lady, for a hostile party, is strange for one of your training. Are you, then, turned Imperialist?</q></p>
            <p><q>No. I have no fear for myself, my lord. But he—he— You must understand, my lord,
                     he believes in—loves his honorable party—whether right or wrong. I would not
                     injure it because of his sake</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have had enough of this weakness, <pb n="73"/>my daughter, and you must admit I have been patient. To relieve your mind, however, of one thing, I will inform you that I have no designs against this young man or his party</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, you lift from my heart, my honored parent, a weight too heavy for me to bear</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Pugh! It seems you are determined not to listen to my orders</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak at once. I will not again interrupt you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very good. While I have said I have nothing against this Imperialist party, I am, nevertheless, desirous of knowing all their plans and secrets. It will be your duty, therefore, to ascertain these for me. Do not interrupt—</q> as she made as if to speak. <q>You would say your lover is too loyal to betray his party secrets, even to you. Then you will use your wit to compel him to do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I—I will do so</q>, she replied, drearily.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>That is not all. I with you to force your love into betraying some scheme or intrigue of his prince which would, if brought to the attention of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, implicate him criminally. Now I have arrived at my chief desire—in other words, I wish to accomplish the ruin—the death of the Prince of Mori</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria’s head swam in vertigo. She scarce could think or feel. Only one horrible thought hammered itself into her mind. By the cajolery and arts of a false woman she<pb n="74"/> was to assist in the betrayal of the prince to whom her lover had sworn allegiance. It was revolting, cruel, horrible. The mere thought of it made her head whirl in dizziness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When she attempted to speak, her words escaped her slowly in gasps.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I can—not—do—that!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>A terrible expression came into her father’s face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You dare defy my authority?</q> he shouted.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, my father, put upon me any other task but this. It is base, cruel, cruel. And I—I am only a weak woman—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is true. Do not, then, I advise you, attempt to pit your weakness against my strength. If you are so lacking in all those qualities admirable in a woman and a daughter of a noble race, I shall take means to force you to do your duty</q>.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p>A sudden wave of courage swept over her. She ceased to tremble, though the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> was fierce and menacing. There sprang into her eyes a light of defiance.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have reminded me, my father, that I come of a race of proud and heroic men.
                     Then let me tell you that I, too, am conscious of possessing the intrepid blood
                     of my ancestors, and that you can force me to do nothing against my
                  will</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As she spoke she had backed slowly across the room, away from her father, as though retreating from a blow. Now she stood against <pb n="75"/>the wall, her arms spread out on either side, the hands clutching the partition.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>In ten minutes I shall show you, my lady</q>, said her father, between angry, clenched teeth, <q>the fate of one who dares defy her honorable parent</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do so</q>, was her astonishing response. <q>Kill me, break all my honorable bones, my lord. We all must suffer and die!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are too quick to choose your method of punishment, my lady. I have a more subtle means of teaching you the duty of a child to its parent. Do not imagine that I shall kill your body. It is your mind and heart I shall crush</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What do you mean, my lord?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You will understand, my lady, when your lover is paying with his life for—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, no, no, no, no!</q> she cried, wildly, her hands groping through blinding emotion as though she would push away from her some horror too awful for utterance. <q>No, no, no!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She fell down at her father’s feet, burying her face in the folds of his <foreign xml:lang="ja">hakama</foreign>, her hands clutched about it frantically. <q>Oh, my father—no, no, no!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She could say no more.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You will obey my commands?</q> inquired the father, bending over her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes—oh, my lord—anything on earth you may command. Only spare him, I beseech you, I pray to you, as I would to a <pb n="76"/>god!</q> She fell to moaning and crying with the weakness of hysteria, no longer brave, defiant.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He raised her not ungently. Holding her hands firmly, he looked sternly into her face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Listen to me, my daughter. The task may seem to you horrible. It should not be so.
                     It is a righteous, holy cause you serve. I have sworn to the dead, pledged
                     myself, to encompass a certain vengeance, which must not escape me now. I have
                     lived for no other purpose. If I have seemed a cold, unfeeling father, stern,
                     unsympathetic and unloving, it is because I have a mission in life greater than
                     that of a father. It is you who must help me to attain this ambition.
                     Vengeance—honest, righteous vengeance—for a wrong done me and mine is a holy
                     cause. No Japanese girl can regard it otherwise. The Prince of Mori is our
                     bitter enemy. We must accomplish his undoing—his death!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes</q>, she said, between her chattering teeth; <q>and you will not harm <emph>him</emph>?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I repeat I have nothing against this man. It is his prince whose proud spirit I will break! Kill!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes—only <emph>his</emph> prince—the old prince. You wish me to kill him? Yes, I will do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No; it is the young prince who must die—the son of the Prince of Mori. Do you not understand that I accomplish a more <pb n="77"/>complete revenge by compassing the death of him who is the salt of his life?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes; I see it clear. I must kill the innocent. Ah-h! Oh, it is cruel, cruel!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She was weeping brokenly, piteously at his feet again, her physical strength quite gone.</p>
                  <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> leaned over her.</p>
               <p><q>Soon, my daughter, you will have regained your strength and will. From your
                     attitude of a little while ago I am made aware that you are possessed of such
                     qualities as might impel you to attempt to betray your father. Be assured that
                     you shall be given no opportunity for doing so. For your own good I would
                     advise you to lay the honorable force of repression upon your disturbed
                     spirits, and bring yourself to do that which I have set for you with
                     completeness and swiftness. In this way you will render a service to your
                     father and family, and save the life of this man you love</q>. </p>

            <p>April danced lightly over the land. Merrily she flung her rainbow showers of sweetest
                  water upon the earth, the trees, the fearsome grass which March had coaxed in vain
                  to do more than peep its head above the soil. Now the land was covered with a
                  mantle so soft and tender that its young life seemed a thing that it were wanton
                  to crush beneath the foo.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Early, early in the morning, before the birds and flowers had cocked up their little
                  heads to seize the first sun-kiss, a lover stood in a garden all <pb n="79"/>made
                  of gently sloping hillocks, crowned with trees whitened, as if frost-laden, with
                  the full bloom of the cherry and plum. And the lover’s voice called softly and
                  tenderly to his lady’s casement:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Lady Wistaria! My sweetest Wistaria!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>At first there was no response. Moving nearer the casement, he called again:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Sweetest, dearest one, will you not come to your window for a minute—but a fraction of a minute?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Softly a hand slid back the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign>—a slender, small,
                  expressive hand of perfect form and contour, and then a young girl’s face appeared
                  at the opening.Her eyes were very dark, and infinitely, intensely sad in
                  expression. Indeed, one might almost wonder whether their very brightness was not
                  caused by the dews of unshed tears. She was pale. There was no color in her face
                  at all, save that of her red lips.</p>
               <p>So pale and ethereal she seemed to her rapturous lover that, for a moment, he was
                  filled with an eerie fear—was she mortal, or one of those fragile spirits who
                  abide on the earth for a season only? Then, all in a moment, her eyes meeting
                  those of her lover, the sadness of the night passed from her like a shadow which
                  is vanquished by the sunlight. An instant later she was again pale.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak to me at once</q>, implored the lover, <q>for but a moment since I thought
                     you a <pb n="80"/>spirit. Dearest one, assure me that my passion is not in
                     vain, and that my eyes deceive me when they fancy that yours are sad</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Her voice faltered and trembled at first. Gradually she steadied it.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My honorable eyes</q>, she said, <q>are not always faithful mirrors of my heart. Yes, indeed, you are deceived, my lord. Look again. Surely you will see that—that they do smile</q>.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>Yes</q>, he replied, regarding her somewhat wistfully, <q>it is true. They do smile, and yet—</q> He hesitated. <q>You do not appear happy, <foreign xml:lang="ja">Fuji-wara</foreign></q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A strange little laugh escaped her lips. But she made no reply. She had turned her eyes from his, staring out before her. As the trouble deepened in the lover’s eyes, he reached up, touching very gently the small white hand on the sill. The light touch of his hand startled her. Before he could speak she had recovered herself, leaning farther over to him. Her words sounded strangely harsh.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord, do let us resume our conversation concerning this brave cause to which you adhere</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He flushed warmly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It seems incongruous</q>, he replied, after a moment, <q>that a tender maiden should be interested in political conflicts</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is very unkind, my lord. You do not credit me, then, with any other quality, apparently, than that of pale softness. Indeed, <pb n="81"/>my vanity has saved me from the knowledge that the gods have been most unkind</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, do not speak so</q>, he tenderly chid her. Of late he had chafed not a little at her persistent waiving aside of all tenderer subjects to discuss those of larger import to men alone.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>Well, then</q>, she persisted, <q>say that I am capricious, whimsical, what you will. But do, pray, humor me, and if I find it necessary</q>—she stammered over her words—<q>if I find it interesting to discuss such matters, pray allow me to do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do so, then, at once, dear one! I am all ears to listen and all tongue to reply</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Pray tell me, then, are you truly an Imperialist at heart, or merely so in name because you are a Mori?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Pray tell me where my insignificant sympathies should lie, and there I swear to you shall they be</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She protested that he but begged her question. Did he, then, consider, because she
                  was but a weak maiden, that her interest in such a matter must needs be a slight
                  thing? Was she not herself a daughter of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, and did not the flame, the
               fire of patriotism glow unceasingly in her breast also?</p><note type="editorial" resp="pers:SC1">An extra end quotation mark in original.</note>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Dear Wistaria</q>, entreated the lover, <q>I pray you do not disturb your gentle bosom with these questions which are meant for soldiers, not for maidens</q>.</p><pb n="82"/>
                  
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, then</q>, she replied, and there were tears in her voice now, <q>why will you persist so? You are quite wrong, too. Let me repeat: I am the daughter of a family whose women have had their honorable share in the affairs of the nation</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>True, but your house has stood always on one side only. They have never deigned even to hear the argument, the pious, patriotic cry of the other side</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My house! Well, my lord, and am I a house?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>He kissed the slender hand on the window-ledge. It reached just to his lips.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, I swear you are a goddess. It could not be possible that one so good and fair would favor an evil cause</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Evil? Ah, then, my lord, is the cause of my house an evil one?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I should be a traitor, my lady, did I take advantage of the friendly hospitality your house has offered me to repay it by sowing seeds of mischief</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But if the seeds were not mischievous, my lord? If they were worthy and good?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>He dropped her hand abruptly, and paced for a time up and down the small grass-grown walk beneath her window.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In the shadow of the room behind the Lady Wistaria another face appeared for the space of a moment only. Long, lean, cadaverous <pb n="83"/>it was, wherein fierce eyes burned like living coals. With a shudder, Wistaria clutched her hand over her heart. Back to her casement came the lover.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My sweetest girl, do not let us discuss so melancholy a subject</q>.</p>
               <p>Impatient to speak with her of other matters nearer his heart, the lover let full,
                  passionate appeal shine in his eyes. Wistaria’s paleness deepened, if that were
                  possible. Her eyes grew humid with repressed sadness. Her voice trembled and broke
                  in spite of her words.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Melancholy, my lord? Nay, you would treat me as a child. You would turn my heart from a lofty subject with the graceless remark that it is too melancholy for me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Lady, I would turn your heart to the holiest of all subjects on earth</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ah, what is that, dear Keiki— No, no, no! Pray excuse my honorable rudeness. Do,
                     pray, my lord, rather perceive my intense curiosity in the matter of which we
                     have spoken. Then when you have enlightened me, speak whatever you will, my
                     lord. I will listen</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And concerning what am I to enlighten you?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The question which cuts our country into two bitter factions, each defiant and warlike towards the other</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Into the lover’s face there crept vague, baf-<pb n="84"/>fled perplexity mirroring the thought
                  beyond. Coquetry, or desire for political truth—which swayed his love? If the
                  former, there was no combating it; if the latter, then—why then he would speak her
                  true. He said:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Will you tell me, then, whom you have been taught to regard as the ruler of Japan?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why, our good <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> Iyesada</q>, she returned, promptly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yet he is not so regarded by every one in Japan</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why is that?</q>
               </p>
               <p><q>Because there are many who would see our rightful sovereign, our divine
                     Emperor, upon the throne</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But, my lord, his Imperial Majesty is, indeed, already upon the throne, is he not?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Only nominally, I fear, my lady, that you have not read the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Dai Nihon Shi</foreign> of the Prince of Mori?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, but I am much interested in it</q>.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>The history</q>, continued the young man, with vehement bitterness, <q>was purged repeatedly by the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Yedo</foreign> censor of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>. It dared to speak the truth to the people. I do assure you it was not destroyed, however, before it had done its work well</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>How? Pray do tell me all about it</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Have you never heard that pious—fanatical, if will—cry, a barely half-muffled war-cry now, ‘<foreign xml:lang="ja">Daigi Heibunor</foreign>!’</q> (the King and the Subject).</p><pb n="85"/>
               <p>His voice rose with a growing passion. Into his eyes leaped the gleam of the
                  patriot.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>An exclamation escaped the lips of the young girl.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, my lord, do not speak so loudly. I would feign warn you. I—I—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She broke off in her agitation. But her apparent fear for him only filled her lover with a great joy. His voice softened.</p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Fiji-wara</foreign>, will you suffer yourself to listen hereafter to a confessed traitor?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Dear lord, traitor to the wrong?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, dearest girl, can it actually be that you sympathize with our noble cause?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I—I— Tell me, do, pray tell me, with whom does the young Prince of Mori
                     sympathize?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, the rascal is a descendant of the Mori of whom I spoke just now</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And an adherent to his views?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Possibly</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You do not know for a fact</q>, she urged, tremulously, <q>just to what party the Prince does adhere?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lady</q>, replied the lover, with some constraint, <q>the Prince has his pride of caste. He is also not without the inherited germs of patriotism in his soul</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And still they do say that he is as silly as a butterfly, and so given to frivolity that his head can hold no serious thought</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do assure you</q>, replied the other, flush-<pb n="86"/>ing warmly, <q>that our prince is
                     not all he may seem</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord, I have conceived the most overwhelming interest in this young Prince Mori</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Indeed!</q> The young man started back in humorous dismay. The girl smiled now, a little, dreary smile.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Be assured, my lord, that the interest is not of a sentimental nature. But it would seem that the young Prince was surely born for a great purpose</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes?</q> inquired the other, eagerly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And that is, to follow in the steps of his honorable ancestor</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, dearest girl, you fill my soul with joy! I am ready to swear that your sweet heart beats for the right—the noble cause to which—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Prince Mori is sworn?</q> she interrupted, quickly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ay! and all the patriotic sons of Japan!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And what do these sons of Japan propose to do? What are the plans of the Prince Mori?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lady!</q></p>
    
      
    
                  <p><q>Pray, why do you start so, Keiki-<foreign xml:lang="ja">sama</foreign>?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You ask a weighty question with the same lightness you would bestow if inquiring about the weather!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Then the tones of my voice do me injustice</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Wistaria, I swear I will not speak an-<pb n="87"/>other word on this subject. No—not even to
                     you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But—</q></p>
               <p><q>No, no. I swear I will not</q>.</p>
               <p><q>My lord—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Did I arise an hour before the sun, think you, to preach politics to my
                     mistress?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You recall the hour to me now. It seems I must bid you farewell. My maid even now is tapping on my door. Do, pray then, depart</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The young man appeared cut to the heart at the parting. He sighed so deeply that Wistaria could not bear to gaze upon him, and, conscious of the impatient presence within, she drew her windows back hastily and shut out the sight of her lover from her. Then she faced her father within.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have heard all, honored parent?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Everything</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are a witness of my continued efforts. I fear we have learned all there is to now</q>.</p>
    
      
    
       <p><q>Your opinion was not asked</q>, replied the father, coldly. <q>Your services are
                     all I require. You will resume them to-morrow</q>.</p>
               <p>The Lady Wistaria prostrated herself before her parent with the utmost humility. </p>
               <p><q>I am prepared to obey your august will in all things</q>, she murmured, in the most
                  filial and submissive of voices.</p>

               <p>The aged castle moat was darkly melancholy, though its banks on either side were beautiful with the damp grass and the meeting willow and wistaria. Cold, still, and deep were its waters. At night it seemed grewsome and uncanny, perhaps because of the tragedy of its history, which every Catzu courtier knew. Even in the bright sunlight its beauty was seductively sad, for its dark waters were covered with white lotus, mingled with red and purple, with golden hearts, whose little cups <pb n="89"/>each held one drop of dew—a glistening tear.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Wandering dejectedly along the banks of the old moat, Keiki vainly sought in his
                  mind for some cluw to the phenomenal change in his mistress. Though at times her
                  eyes seemed drowned in tears of tenderness, more often they were coldly glassy.
                  Her conversation, too, was spasmodic, devoid of all endearment, and of a sort
                  alien to lovers. When he had first seen her after the illness which had kept her
                  from his sight for some days, he had lost all self-control in the joy of beholding
                  her once more. In ardent imagination he revived the memory of those dream-days on
                  the little rock island of the twenty <foreign xml:lang="ja">geishas</foreign>, but though she appeared to have
                  recovered her health, she no longer accompanied him upon such excursions. Indeed,
                  she was rarely seen in the Catzu palace, except on the formal occasions of the
                  guest-room. Keiki had been forced to content himself with those early morning
                  meetings at her casement, so brief, so unsatisfactory. For she no longer murmured
                  shy words of love and happiness. She talked, instead, of ridiculous matters, the
                  politics of the country!</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Nevertheless, through her apparent sympathy for this cause so close to the heart of the young man, she had revivified those thrills of patriotism which, for the nonce, he had <pb n="90"/>pushed aside to devote all his heart and mind to the sweeter employment of loving.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>In a moment of enthusiasm, only two days before, he had confided to her the far-reaching plans of the Mori princes for their country. She had begged him with tears in her eyes to tell her of them; then, before he had half finished, she had entreated him wildly to tell her no more, and the next instant, piteously, tremblingly, begged him to continue. And then as he went on she had dropped her head upon her arms and buried her face from his sight. Her emotion had thrilled him. At the moment he could have fallen on his knees, beseeching her to do something to hasten their marriage so that he might return to Choshui to do his part in this noble cause. Before he could speak, however, she had raised her face and gazed for a moment upon him with such an expression of penetrating agony and appeal that he had sprung towards her, hastily crying out her name, <q>Wistaria! Wistaria!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>A moment later she was gone. The following morning he had waited in vain in the garden beneath her casement. Over and over again he had tapped upon her shutters and called her name, but there was no response. He had met with the same experience this morning. Keiki was very miserable. Since the change in her seemed inexplicable, his confidence was shaken—not his confidence <pb n="91"/>in her faith or truthfulness, but in her love. He began to torture his mind with the possibility that she might not love him, that she had been but a girl, after all, who, flattered by his manner of wooing her, had thought she returned his affection. His faith in her purity of soul was so perfect that no slightest thought of any designs upon his political schemes ever occurred to him in connection with Wistaria.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Thus unhappy, worried, and very much in love, Keiki walked moodily along the bank of the old castle moat, his old assurance and egotism completely gone from him.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Suddenly as he strolled along something struck him sharply on the temple. Stooping, he raised from the ground what seemed to be a soft pebble. Examining it more closely, however, he perceived it to be a lady’s fine paper handkerchief rolled into a little ball. Half wonderingly, half idly, Keiki undid it. A faint, familiar perfume exuded from it as he shook it out. In an instant he was pressing it rapturously to his face. It was from Wistaria. Tenderly turning it about and enjoying its sweetness, he found as he was smoothing it out a little word in the centre:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Go</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>The lover became pale as death. He read it again, then repeated it aloud—<q>Go!</q> Its meaning was plain. He did not doubt for an instant from whom it came. That one <pb n="92"/>little word from her explained everything—the change in her, her realization that she did not love him, and this silent means of telling him the truth. He <choice><sic>crumpled</sic><corr>crumbled</corr></choice> the handkerchief in his hand. A moment later he was pacing—almost running—up and down along the bank of the silent, mocking moat. He could not think. He could only feel. Then he threw himself prone upon the ground, his face buried in the long grasses. He was smothering and choking back the hoarse, terrible sobs of a man—one who had been trained in the inflexible school of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>The day passed over his head. The sky, ruddy with the setting sun, paled gradually, until it seemed as though a veil were drawn softly across it. Still Keiki gave himself up to his despair. For him it seemed that the sun had gone out, life had ceased.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>As the shadows continued to spread their batlike wings over the heavens,
                  darkening, darkening the skies, until only an impenetrable vault of darkness
                  dotted with myriad magic lights was above and about him, he still lay there.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>A rustle disturbed the grass. Possibly a hare running by. Keiki heeded it not. Something was stirring, moving near him. Mechanically, dully, he listened. Some one had lost his way among the willows and with his hands was feeling his way. From his <pb n="93"/>own despair Keiki was recalled by the sudden acute knowledge of possible danger to this person who had evidently lost his way. One false step towards the boggy grass, and beyond was the treacherous moat, whose water-flowers and reeds hid its dark surface. Suddenly he sprang to his feet and called out hoarsely:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Who is the honorable one?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He fancied he heard a cry. He ran towards it, then stopped short. He had come upon her there in the willows. Her <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign> shone out startlingly white with a stray moon-beam upon it, but her gown was not less white than her face, which stared into the darkness like that of a statue.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Slowly he went to her as though drawn by subtle, compelling hands. Close to her, almost touching her; he did not speak, because he could not. Bitter words had sprung to his lips only to die before birth. He perceived that she was trembling from head to foot. Her hands stood out from her sleeves, each finger apart, and they trembled, quivered, shook.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>With an inarticulate cry he caught them in his own, inclosing them warmly, almost savagely, in his grasp. Then his voice came to him. It was very husky and strange.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Speak!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Go!—Go!</q></p>
               <p>This was all she whisperingly cried. She <pb n="94"/>kept repeating it over and over between her chattering teeth. As he wound his arms about her shivering form he found that she was dripping wet. Could it be that she had fallen into the moat? By what miracle of the gods, then, had she been saved? The dark waters were so deep—so deep!</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>You are wet and cold! You have met with an accident?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>No, no</q>, she said. <q>It was the honorable grass—so wet—so cold, like a lake. I crawled through it, on my hands and knees, close to the moat</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>But why did you do it, why did you do it?</q> His voice was imploring.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>To come to you. To be with you—to—</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He clasped her closer, warmed to the soul by her words.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Ah, then it is not true</q>, he cried, <q>and you do still love me, <foreign xml:lang="ja">Fuji-wara</foreign>?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Better than my soul. Better than my duty to the gods</q>, she whispered.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>The sound of her voice was muffled. Her words literally sighed through her lips. He could not comprehend; he knew only that she loved him, had come to him, and now she was all water-wet, pale-eyed, and trembling as one who sleeps with fear. And because that strange voice hurt his soul, he covered her lips with his hand. She made no remonstrance, but sank into his arms, almost as if she had fainted. But looking down he <pb n="95"/>saw her eyes were wide open, shining like dark stars. They startled him. They were like those of a dead woman. He shook her almost roughly in his fright.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Wistaria! Speak to me! What is it? Tell me your trouble</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Trouble?</q> she repeated, dazedly. <q>Trouble!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Then she remembered. She grasped his arm till her fingers almost pierced through the silk into his flesh.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>You must go—go! Go quickly—run all the way. Do not stop one moment—not one little moment</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Go away? Run? What are you saying?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Listen! In a moment, perhaps, I may not have power to speak. My strength is failing me. I thought you would obey the word I sent you. But I saw you fall down among the grasses, and all day long I have watched from my window, waiting, waiting, waiting to see you depart. No, no—listen unto me—do not speak. I escaped the vigilance of my jailers—my executioners. Oh, will you not understand? I have come through perils you cannot imagine to warn you—to beg you on my knees to go away at once. Hasten to Choshui!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Her breath failed her. She had been speaking quickly, in sharp gasps.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>But I do not understand</q>, he said.</p><pb n="96"/>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Your prince—your august prince is in danger!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>What?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>The Prince of—the young Prince Keiki</q>, she gasped.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>The young Prince Keiki!</q> he repeated, incredulously.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Yes, yes; they have discovered his secrets—they will arrest him for treason and—</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He almost shouted.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>His secrets! The cause! Oh, all the gods!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>You can save him. There may be time. They will take him and cast him into a dungeon and kill him!</q></p>
               <p><q>I must set off at once</q>, excitedly he muttered. <q>What could have happened in my absence?</q></p>
               <p>Her shivering, trembling presence recalled him. He was distracted at the thought of leaving her. He could think of nothing else. He tried to see her white face in the darkness, but could only trace the pale outlines. Suddenly he took it in his hands.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Fuji-wara</foreign></q>, he whispered, in a voice of mingled love and agony. <q>How can I leave you? How can I do so? And yet you would not have me act the part of a coward, the false traitor. You would be the first to bid me go</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Go, go!</q> she cried, releasing herself from his hands feverishly.</p><pb n="97"/>
               
               
               
               <p><q>And you?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Lead me back into the path. I shall find my way from there</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Leading her, he questioned anxiously:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>There is danger for you here, Wistaria? Tell me, or I shall not depart</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>She turned the question.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Last night there was a slight earthquake in the province. There is always danger. But you and I have pledged each other. For the time of this life and the next, and as many after as may come, I will be your flower-wife and you my husband</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>At parting he kissed the hem of her <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign> and the little, water-soaked foot beneath.</p>

               <p>When the tender veil of the first hours of the morning was raised from the face of the sun, the early light revealed a small, still, white face at a window where the morning-glory, rising from the midst of spring roses, mingled with the wild ivy of Japan, clambered up and encircled the casement, and nodded until the blossoms touched and caressed the small, dark head. The eyes, darkly overcast with ceaseless watching, stared out through the mist of the morning, across the musk-laden gardens and <pb n="99"/>over the silent moat, trying to pierce with the vision of love the distance beyond the lines of the province.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Thus all night long had the delicate Lady Wistaria crouched at her casement. Did the night winds stir the long grasses or rattle the boughs of the trees and bushes, the young girl started and trembled with unspeakable fear. Did the steady beat, beat of the wooden sandals of the guards at the palace gates for a moment cease or increase their rhythmic, orderly tramp, her heart bounded up, then almost stopped its beating. The slightest sound or stir made her tremble and quiver. Only the nightingale, softly, piercingly, ceaselessly singing throughout the night, comforted and soothed her like the song of an angel. Under its soothing influence she had fallen asleep, with her little, tired head upon her arms. But even while she slept, she sighed and trembled. Awaking before daybreak, she heeded not the shivering breezes of the passing night, but waited for the sunlight.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>An alert guard of the palace gates, after the night watch, was wending his way through one of the paths which led out of the grounds, when he thought he heard some one calling his name. It was very early. But for the chirping of a few waking birds, the gardens were very silent and still. He stopped short in his walk and listened. There it was again—a woman’s or a child’s voice, calling <pb n="100"/>his name, softly, almost appealingly. Turning sharply, the guard retraced his steps down the path, looking about him anxiously as he neared the palace.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">O-Yone</foreign>! <foreign xml:lang="ja">Yone-yara</foreign>!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He turned in the direction of the voice.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">O-Yone</foreign>! This way! It is I—your lady!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Then the guard saw the Lady Wistaria leaning far out from her casement. He ran forward and dropped on his knees, touching the earth with his head.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Closer! Still closer!</q> she called, in a whisper.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Yes, my lady!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He knelt close under her casement, his head bent, and respectfully attentive.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>She whispered.</p>
               <p><q>I wish you to do me a service; will you not, Yone?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Oh, my lady!</q> was all the young man could stammer, out of his eagerness to serve her.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>I know you are tired after your watch, and it was long—so long!</q> She sighed, as though she, too, had kept the watch with him.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>No, no!</q> cried the young guard hastily. <q>Indeed I am honorably fresh, my lady. Do not spare me any service</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Then do you please run as swiftly as your honorable feet will carry you to the home <pb n="101"/>of Sir Takemoto Genji, and bid him hasten to me here at once, without one moment’s delay. Now hasten—do not wait!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>Like a flash of wind the young soldier had sprung to his feet, had leaped across
                  the small division to the bridge spanning the moat, and was speeding through the
                  wooded park beyond.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>In less than fifteen minutes the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji was bending the knee to the Lady Wistaria.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Thy service, my lady!</q></p>

               <p><q>Why, my little lady?</q> The big <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> was on his feet, regarding her with amazed eyes.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Yes, yes—I know it seems incredible to you that I should have trouble of any sort, but indeed it is so, and—</q></p>

               <p><q>You will be my very good friend, will you not, Sir Gen?</q></p>
               <p><q>Friend! Command me to cut myself in half and I will do so at once!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Last night</q>, she whispered, <q>he—</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>He nodded comprehendingly, certain that only one <q>he</q> could exist in my
                  lady’s mind.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>—he escaped!</q> she gasped.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Escaped?</q></p>

               <p><q>Oh, you know—you know of whom I speak</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Yes, yes—certainly; but how do you mean—escaped? He was our honored guest, was he not?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>His prince is my father’s mortal enemy. My father has been my jailer for many days now, and I—I have been forced to cause him to betray his prince. Oh, will you not understand!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Hah! It is all quite plain! But why did you not inform me sooner?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Because until yesterday my father kept so constant a watch over me that I could make no movement he would not have perceived. But do not ask useless questions now, Gen. Help me. Tell me what to do—what to do</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>You say he has escaped? When and how did he go?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Last night, Gen. I climbed down the vine of the casement here. See, it is strong. My father for the first time had not been near me all day, and I thought I was safe from observation, though indeed I could not be sure. But I went to him and warned him of the danger, and he has gone to Choshui</q>.</p>

               <p><q>But my father may know the truth and will track him through the woods. I cannot live for the fear, the august dread, of what may befall him</q>.</p><pb n="103"/>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Do not tremble so, my lady. Things are not so dark as they seem. It is quite impossible for your father to have overheard you; he left Catzu at noon yesterday</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Ah! Then if that is so, it will be too late to warn the young Prince Mori</q>, she cried.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>But do not think of this prince, my lady. Be happy that your august lover is safe</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Oh</q>, she cried despairingly, <q>but I cannot have the death of this innocent prince upon my hands. I should die if anything happened to him</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Well, do take some comfort, my lady. You say your lover departed last night. Very good. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu left yesterday at noon. Yet the young man, I am ready to swear by my sword, will be the first to reach Choshui</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, but vengeance and hatred will lend wings to my parent’s feet</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>And the wings of vengeance and hatred, my lady, are not so fleet as those of the wings of love. Be assured</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Sir Gen, you do not know, you would not believe all I have suffered</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Sir Genji’s brows contracted. Ever since he had followed her to the old Catzu
                  palace, when she was a tiny, bewitching little creature of five, with laughing
                  lips and shining eyes, a flower ornament tumbling down the side of her hair and a
                  miniature <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign> tied about <pb n="104"/>with a purple
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">obi</foreign>, she had been his favorite. He could
                  scarcely believe it possible that any one could be cruel to this beautiful young
                  girl. His looks just then bode ill for any one who should cause her pain.
                  Nevertheless, for many days now the young girl’s chamber had been not unlike that
                  of an inquisitorial prison. It was true there were no thumb-screws or neck-halters
                  or burning-irons within, but there were instruments of torture more refined and
                  excruciating in their torture, because they pierced the mind rather than the
                  body.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>If the girl awoke screaming in the night, one could be sure that some creeping, spying presence had entered her chamber and had grown upon the consciousness of her dreams, rudely awakening her to the fearful nightmare of an unseen presence. In the early morning she was awakened from her sleep and forced to carry on those nerve-shocking, heart-breaking interviews with her lover. She fell asleep at night with the intuitive knowledge that one watched unceasingly in her chamber. She might make no stir or movement unobserved.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>This Sir Genji heard for the first time.</p>
               <p><q>And I may rely on you for the future?</q> she asked, in conclusion.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> raised his sword.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>With this, gentle lady, I’ll serve thee and him</q>, he said.</p><pb n="105"/>
               
               
               
               <p>Then with a quick movement he flung the sword to the ground.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Three days passed away. She seemed like one in a dream, under a spell, as she hung
                  over her flowers. Under the fruit-trees she wandered. Their petals, odorous and
                  dewy-laden, fell around and upon her like a cloud of summer snow-flakes. They made
                  her quiver with memories that caused her pain. She ran through the grasses away
                  from them, her little feet scattering the petals before her, seeking the banks of
                  the moat far away from where he had been wont to stand at the dawning, pleading
                  for her love.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>But the lotus with the dew in its cups smiled but to weep. She threw herself down by the water’s edge, and swept with her hand the lotus back from the surface of the water. The flowers at her touch left one little oval spot, out of which her small face shone up at her with its startled eyes of tragedy. She fancied it a magic mirror wherein the face of the divine goddess of mercy was reflected. So she prayed to the goddess very softly, and quite as one whose mind has been overweighted with trouble, for peace and mercy for that wilful and foolish Lady Wistaria, whose lover had passed out of her life and gone the gods knew whither. And the lips of the goddess in the water moved in soundless response, but, <q>He is gone—gone!</q> said the hapless Lady Wistaria.</p>

            <div type="chapter" n="12">
               <head>XII</head>
               <p>The Lady Wistaria was carried to her father’s home at night. There was no gorgeous
                  cortège, no gayly bedecked attendants or retainers to bend the back and knee to
                  her. She travelled alone, in a covered palanquin borne on the shoulders of hired
                  runners, beside whom the tall, lank figure of her father strode. They set her down
                  in the heart of the city, the rest of the journey being made on foot. When she had
                  last visited her father’s home he had carried her on his back, after he had
                  dismissed the palanquin, for she <pb n="107"/>was then but a small girl of ten.
                  Now she walked silently, dumbly, by his side. As they reached and passed through
                  the silent little village that had impressed her as a child, strange fancies
                  flitted in and out of Wistaria’s mind. There was none of that strange up-leaping
                  of the heart, experienced on returning to a home not seen for years. The old
                  mystic horror and fear of the place had taken possession of Wistaria, but now,
                  with a woman’s wide-open eyes, her wonder and fear began to form themselves into
                  vague fancies.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Slowly passing along the silent, spiral streets, climbing up and around hillock after hillock, they came finally before the small, whitewashed house with its dark, empty, cold interior. The old, old woman who had fondled and sung to the child Wistaria came hobbling and mumbling to the door. She wept over Wistaria’s hands, caressed them, and drew her head to her bosom with a crooning laugh that was almost a sob.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>I am very weary and would fain retire at once</q>, said Wistaria, as she returned the old woman’s caress.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Madame Mume attended Wistaria tenderly towards the stairway which led to the upper part of the house. But, as she did so, Shimadzu called to his daughter in his hollow voice of command.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Stay</q>, he said. <q>I have much to say to you to-night</q>.</p><pb n="108"/>
               
               
               
               <p>Bowing obediently, if wearily, to her father. Wistaria handed her cape to the old woman and mechanically followed him into the <foreign xml:lang="ja">ozashiki</foreign>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>My daughter</q>, began the father, <q>do you know where you now are?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p>This strange question surprised Wistaria, but she replied, with a gentle smile:</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>In my honorable father’s house</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>That is true, but do you know where your father’s house is situated?</q></p>
               <p><q>No</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Very well; I will tell you, then. My house, though seemingly apart, because of its situation on the hill, is built in the heart of an 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> settlement</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>?</q> repeated Wistaria, mechanically. She had heard the word somewhere before, but just what it signified her mind at the moment could not recall. So she repeated the word again, as though it troubled yet fascinated her. <q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>!—<foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>!</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign></q>, repeated her father. <q>In other
                     words, the social outcast, the despised pariah class of Japan</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Then silence fell like a swift, blank darkness upon them. Wistaria trembled with a creeping horror she could not fathom or grasp.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Somewhere, somehow, vaguely, dimly, she had heard of this class of people. Perhaps it was at school. Perhaps her aunt had instructed her in their condition. One thing <pb n="109"/>was certain, she was suddenly made aware of just what the one word <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> signified.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>It described a class in Japan upon whom the ban of ostracism and isolation had
                  been placed by an inviolate heritage and a cruel custom. So virulent and bitter
                  was the prejudice against them and the contempt in which they were held, that in
                  the enumerations of the population they were omitted from the count and numbered
                  as cattle.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Herded in separate villages, their existence ignored by the communities, none but the most degraded tasks were assigned to them—that of burying criminals, slaughtering cattle, that of the hangman and public executioner.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Whence they had come, why there were held in the contempt of all other citizens, what their origin, none could tell. When had there been a time in the history of the nation that they did not exist? Some old histories aver that they were originally captives from the great Armada of the Tartar invaders who dreamed of conquering the sacred realm. Others declare that they were the descendants of the public executioners from time immemorial; and again, more recent students assert that they were descendants of the family and retainers of Taira-No-Masakado-Heishimo, the only man in Japan who ever seriously conspired to seize the imperial throne by armed force. Whatever their origin, they were the outcast people of the realm. They <pb n="110"/>were not permitted to mingle with or marry outside of their own class, and any one who chose to marry among them must either suffer the penalty of death or become one of them.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>The long silence which ensued after Shimadzu had spoken the word <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> was broken by the Lady Wistaria.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>And why</q>, she asked, with a tremor she could not keep from her voice—<q>why does my honorable father make his home among this outcast people?</q></p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Because</q>, quickly came the passionate response, <q>your honorable father is an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>, as is also my lady his daughter</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Wistaria’s eyes, wide with shocked surprise, stared mutely up into her father’s face. What! she—the Lady Wistaria, the dainty, cultivated, carefully guarded and nurtured lady—an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> girl! Her mind could not grasp, would not hold the thought.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Listen</q>, said her father, slowly. <q>I was born in a city of the south, the seat of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">daimio</foreign> of eight hundred thousand <foreign xml:lang="ja">koku</foreign>. My father’s house stood within the outer fortifications surrounding this prince’s castle. I was trained in the school of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. I grew up, honoring and swearing by this prince. When I became of age I entered his service. No love of man for woman was more persistent than my loyalty to his cause. Devotion to him was my highest ideal</q>.<note type="editorial" resp="pers:SC1">No end quotation mark in

               <p><q>My prince had a bitter rival and enemy. <pb n="111"/>He was a good and powerful lord, though a <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> favorite. This lord loved my sister and was loved by her. In an evil moment I listened to her entreaties, and forgot my allegiance to my prince in so far as to assist his rival to win and wed my sister, now the Lady of Catzu. Immediately I brought down upon my head the bitterest detestation of my own prince. I was assigned to the porest and most degrading of posts, that of the spy and the suppressor of petty broils, and finally detailed to live in and protect a certain <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> settlement. So much of my time was thus forcibly spent among these people that I came to study, to understand, and finally to sympathize with them</q>.<note type="editorial" resp="pers:SC1">No end quotation mark in

               <p>With a sudden little sob, Wistaria moved closer to him and drew his hands up to her lips.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>My mother?</q> The words passed her lips as a quick, burning question.</p><pb n="112"/>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Thy mother</q>, he repeated, and then she saw in the dim light of the room the great, shining tears roll down the hard crevices in her father’s face. She moaned and crept closer to him.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>For her I became an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>—an outcast. Do not shudder, my daughter. Has the word, then, so evil a sound? Then I perceive you have been wrongly bred—in the school of prejudice. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>, though an outcast, is a human being—more human, indeed, than many of our disdainful lords who ride over their heads and trample them like insects beneath their feet</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Tell me of my mother</q>, she whispered.</p>
               
               
               
               <p><q>Of her antecedents I know naught and care less. Her honorable grandmother still abides here in my house</q>.</p>

               <p><q>After my marriage I was cast off immediately by my prince, my titles and honors were taken from me, my property confiscated. For all this I cared nothing. I was content and happy to be left at peace with my wife</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>His long, thin fingers clinched and unclonched. He moistened his lips, biting into

               <p><q>Did I say that this prince under whom I served was arrogant and cruel? Did I
                     tell you he had a heart of flint and a pride so <pb n="113"/>indomitable that
                     he would not brook one of his <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> being
                     other than of noble birth? Six of his vassals, the most graceless and worthless
                     in the province, to humor his pleasure, undertook to seek me out in my exiled
                     happiness and engage to make life intolerable for me. Whether their actual
                     intention was evil or not, I cannot say; that they wrought evil is all I know,
                     and that they came with the express knowledge and consent of their
                  prince</q>.</p>
               
               
               
               <p>Wistaria observed that her father was trembling so violently that he scarce could speak. She pressed his hands convulsively within her own.</p>

               <p><q>They murdered her</q>, he whispered, hoarsely. <q>Curses and maledictions upon their souls!</q></p>

               <head>XIII</head>
                 <p>The death of the mother of Wistaria had taken place the day after the girl’s birth. Her father had left his young <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> wife to go to the village to purchase medicines and food. She was in the care of her grandmother, who was old and weak, and powerless to protect her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Mori <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, all of them in a state of savage intoxication, had come to the house demanding and calling for Shimadzu. They had been drinking heavily all day, and swore they would have their final cup with their former comrade.</p><pb n="115"/>
    
      
    
               <p>When Madame Mume assured them of his absence, they insisted upon entering the house, and, pushing past the old woman, straightway took possession of the place. One of their number suggested that in the absence of Shimadzu they must be entertained by his <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> wife, whereupon the others, taking up the cry, boisterously began to shout for the hostess of the house.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Meanwhile the young wife, very weak and ill from her recent confinement, listened with feverish excitement to the loud voices and the bedlam of noises now rattling through the little cottage. Fearful for the safety of her lord, in a moment of delirium she arose from her sick bed to go to them, staggering through the dividing rooms until she came to the ribald debauchees.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As she pushed aside the sliding doors and stood in the opening, her white bed-robes about her, she seemed like an apparition. A sudden silence fell upon the revellers. It was broken by a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> whose <foreign xml:lang="ja">sake</foreign> cup dropped from his nerveless hand to the floor, where it shattered into fragments.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The next instant there was a general movement towards the figure between the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign>. That simultaneous, half-savage advance seemed to snap the last vital cord in the woman. When they reached her she no longer swayed between the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign>. They bent over her in various attitudes of horror, where she lay prone <pb n="116"/>at their feet, a white, crushed thing whose delicate life had been brutally snuffed out forever.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With a loud cry of fear and dismay they rushed from the chamber, out from the house
                  into the open air, where their befogged brains still seemed to behold a vision of
                  an avenging, pursuing spirit.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Hearing the wailing cries of the old grandmother while he was yet afar off from the
                  house, Shimadzu began to run at his utmost speed, a premonition of disaster
                  forcing itself upon him. Up the hillocks he sped. A moment of fearful, striving
                  effort and he was beside the old woman. Something froze in Shimadzu, paralyzing
                  his faculties. Power of speech and movement was gone.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The old woman caught his arm, shook it, and gazed with her fading eyesight into his staring  eyes.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Master, master!</q> she cried.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He only stared at the figure upon the floor. The old woman rushed from the house, shrieking and calling aloud for help. Neighbors came rushing up from the little village below and began to fill the house. They tried to arouse the stricken <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, but he heeded them not. But when they attempted to move the young wife, a strange guttural sound of savage protest escaped his lips, so that they dared not touch her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then the neighbors mingled their cries with those of the old woman, and the house of <pb n="117"/>death was rendered hideous with their ceaseless moaning and the muffled beating of <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shinto</foreign> drums.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>All night long the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> crouched in that
                  paralyzed attitude by the side of his wife. But in the morning strong and stout
                  armed men from the village, disregarding his cries of protest, lifted the body of
                  the wife upon the death-couch, drew the lids over the staring eyes, closed the
                  frothed mouth, where the teeth shone out like small white fangs, and folded the
                  frozen white hands across her breast. Then the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> came back to life—vivid, horrible, insane life.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Some kindly woman brought in the little Wistaria and held her towards him with a pitying exclamation, knowing that this little life could not but comfort the bereft man. He seized the child wildly in his arms. Then holding his one-day old babe over the dead body of his wife, he swore a fearful oath of vengeance.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>From that day the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> had but one purpose in
                  life, but one hope and ambition: to encompass the ruin and death of those he
                  deemed the murderers of his wife. It happened that he came of a powerful family,
                  who, in all his troubles, had offered him their sympathy and would gladly have
                  received him back among them in spite of his marriage to an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> girl. They were in high favor at court, and now they carried his
                  case to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>
                  <pb n="118"/>himself. The exiled <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> was
                  forthwith ordered to appear before the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>,
                  who had been deeply impressed and touched by his sorrows, and who had cause for
                  prejudice against his former lord.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> offered to force his lord to restore to
                  the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> his estates and rank, but Shimadzu
                  fiercely refused to accept these favors, wildly declaring that he would rather be
                  buried alive than enter the service of such a lord. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, still anxious to please his family, begged him to make some
                  request which it would be in his power to grant, whether for service under another
                  lord, or at court in attendance upon his own person.</p>
    
      
    
               <p><q>I have but one request to make, my lord</q>, responded the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is?—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>To be made the public executioner</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>All these things the Lady Wistaria now learned for the first time. She was as one struck down by a sudden shock of grief. In one little hour she had fallen from a great height, and had learned of things that had caused her to quiver with anguish and shame. She could not at once share the thought of the father whose wrongs haunted him, demanding vengeance and justice. She thought, instead, of other things. She was the daughter of the public executioner, the hangman!—an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> girl—an outcast! The odium of it all crushed her. In that hour of agony <pb n="119"/>her imagination conjured up the noble, highborn face of her lover, torturing her soul with its infinite distance from her. She knew now that he was as far beyond her reach as the sun.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Shrink not, my daughter</q>, came her father’s voice harshly upon her thoughts;
                     <q>your father’s [hands are not stained in the blood of any of his fellow-men
                     save those who were his by divine right. To underlings I gave the punishment of
                     the public criminal, but to myself I kept the sacred task of seeking, tracking,
                     ruining and killing with my own hands the destroyers of my house</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Then</q>, said Wistaria, in a strangely pleading voice, <q>you have avenged my mother. All is done, all is finished. Oh, my father, let us forget all this past, and go away where we may not be known and pass our days in peace until the end</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, all is not done</q>, replied the father. <q>You forget that while I have had the holy joy of executing the six murderers of my wife, their prince still lives</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ah!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Once I served under him, honored him above all men; now I desire nothing else on earth but to bow his head in the dust. He is a great prince, beyond my reach, but I have sought and found a better means of striking at him. For this purpose, my daughter, I need your aid</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You mean—</q> she began.</p><pb n="120"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>This Prince of Mori is the man. Now you understand. His heart, his whole life, is wrapped up in his son. But yesterday, my daughter, I caught that son in the trap which I set through you. To-morrow he pays the penalty of the sins of his father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria tottered to her feet. Then she fell on her knees and crept upon them to her father.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Father, dear, my father, I beg, I implore you to show mercy</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>For whom do you ask mercy, my lady?</q> asked the father.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>For the innocent—for this young Prince of Mori</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You—you ask mercy for this prince!—you, the daughter of a murdered woman!</q> In an instant she was sitting up stiff and rigid.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, she said, <q>I am, indeed, too insignificant and unworthy to be thy daughter, but for one small moment I did forget our wrongs and fain would have spared my soul the sacrifice of innocent blood</q>.</p>

            <head>XIV</head>
    
      
    
            <p>Early in the morning the inhabitants of the little <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> village were startled by the unusual sound in the streets of the
                     <q>clip-clop</q> of palanquin runners’ sandals. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> were not used to being carried in gilded <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimonos</foreign>, or of traveling in any other fashion than on foot.
                  Consequently, the spectacle of an exquisitely finished <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign> carried on the shoulders of liveried attendants, created as
                  much stir as it is possible for the placid Japanese to manifest. The bamboo
                  curtains of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>
                  <pb n="122"/>were closely drawn. The runners sped swiftly along, paying no heed to
                  the raised shutters or the curious eyes at the wall holes. On either side of the
                  palanquin two couriers or personal <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>
                  walked.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The runners stopped before the house of Shimadzu, and, having thrown aside the
                  curtains, bowed low as they backed before a veiled lady, who stepped from the
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign>. The lady, however, unmindful of her
                  bending servitors, hurried up the gravelled pathway to beat upon the door with her
                  delicate fists.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The early morning visitor entered the house before the Lady Wistaria had descended from her chamber. When she threw back the covering from her head, the proud face of the Lady Evening Glory appeared with all its cold beauty and strange pallor. Her lips trembled so that she could not keep them together.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She had traveled all night in the utmost haste to throw herself at the feet of her brother, praying his mercy for the young Prince of Mori. She did not wait for her brother to question her, but began at once a pitiful, disjointed tale concerning her son Toro.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The young man had involved himself in great trouble in the Choshui province, and was
                  now held a prisoner by the Prince of Mori. Toro, the foolhardy, imitating the
                  actions of the young courtier of the Mori clan, <pb n="123"/>had fared badly.
                  Caught scaling the walls surrounding the palace of the father of the Lady
                  Hollyhock, he had been arrested and brought before the Prince of Mori. This
                  nobleman had at first intended to return the young fellow to his neighbor
                  courteously, with some satirical rebuke which would scorch the vanity of the boy’s
                  father, but just at this juncture had come the fearful intelligence of the arrest,
                  secret trial for treason, and sentence to death of the young heir of Mori. The old
                  Prince, rendered frantic with fear and anguish, despatched word immediately to
                  Catzu that unless the Prince Keiki were spared, the same fate should be meted out
                  to the young Catzu Toro.</p>
    
      
    
       <p>So the Lady Evening Glory had come now to her brother to demand, to beg the pardon of
                  their enemy, this young Prince of Mori, while her husband had hastened to Yedo to
                  seek the aid of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>. Nevertheless, both
                  father and mother knew that the fate of their son depended not upon the august
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, but upon their brother, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu, for the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> would scarcely have time to send forces to compel Mori to
                  release Toro before the execution of Keiki took place, which would be undoubtedly
                  the signal for the immediate despatch of Toro.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The unexpected answer the lady received from her brother stunned her so completely <pb n="124"/>that she was robbed of all hope. Now she suffered in turn all the pangs of frantic despair and agony that her niece had so lately undergone through her agency.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What!</q> cried the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, with stern derision, <q>permit the consummation of the work of a lifetime of misery and torture to slip through my aching fingers now? Not for a thousand nephews!</q></p>
            <p>Yet he endeavored in his rough and stern way to comfort his sister with these strange words:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Catzu Toro is of <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> blood. It behooves him, therefore, to give up fearlessly his life for the honor of his family. He ought to bless the gods for the opportunity</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The mother wept, prayed, threatened. All in vain. Shimadzu was inflexible. Meanwhile the hour which had been set for the execution of the young Prince of Mori approached with more than the natural speed of time, and the Lady Evening Glory’s couriers, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji and Matsue, waited in agonized impatience for word of truce to carry to the old Prince of Mori.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Finding all her efforts to move her brother unavailing, the Lady of Catzu sought desperately though impotently to bar his egress from the room. She clutched the dividing 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> which opened into the corridor, then placed her back against them. When Shimadzu turned to the doors on the opposite <pb n="125"/>side she rushed before him, and again sought to prevent his departure. Firmly, but not ungently, Shimadzu put her aside, whereupon she fell down at his feet, clasping her arms about his legs, while her lips emitted strange and piteous outcries.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Yet what could the utmost strength of a delicate lady do against that of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> man? With one quick movement he freed himself
                  from her clinging hands. The next moment the Lady Evening Glory was quite alone.
                  She suddenly realized that the gods had denied her all succor, and crawled across
                  the room until she stood in front of the small shrine in the place of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">tokonona</foreign>. There she prostrated herself, but her lips
                  could not frame themselves in petition to the gods.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>How long she lay thus she could not have told. Gradually she became conscious that some one was kneeling beside her, and that a soft and tender hand was smoothing back the wild hair that escaped about her face. A gentle voice whispered:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The gods are good—good! Take heart! They will not desert us! The gods are good!</q></p>
            <p>Then the proud Lady of Catzu, raising herself to a kneeling posture, gazing up into the bending, pitying face above her, saw her niece, whom she had so vindictively persecuted. Before she could speak one word, Wistaria drew her hand to her breast. Then the <pb n="126"/>bereaved mother gave way to a passion of tears of weakness and despair.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are calmer now, dear aunt</q>, said the Lady Wistaria after a while. <q>Weep no more, I pray you. But try rather to bring your mind to think clearly with mine. We must conceive some way by which we can outwit my honorable parent. We have yet two hours before the time when my father will depart for—for his prisoner</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>But the after-effects of weeping, great sighs, rendered the Lady Evening Glory speechless. She could only shake her head hopelessly, helplessly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>All night long</q>, said Wistaria, <q>I have kept a vigil. I have thought and
                     thought and thought, until my brains has seemed ready to burst. I too, my lady,
                     have yielded myself to such despair as you now feel. I suffer more than the
                     pain of one who loses a beloved, for I am tortured with the knowledge that I am
                     guilty. Oh, lady, was it not I who betrayed this prince, and would I not be the
                     indirect cause of dear Toro’s death also? Therefore it is my task to save the
                     life of this prince, if that can be done</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But it cannot—cannot</q>, moaned the Lady Evening Glory. <q>Thou knowest not thy father!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And yet</q>, said Wistaria, slowly, <q>I have thought of one way</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Anata!</foreign></q></p><pb n="127"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Tell me first, my lady, is it not so—that one who marries an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> is forever after disgraced—branded?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes, that is true—but—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is of importance that I know all this. Now is it not also true that my father’s chief ambition is to break the pride and spirit of the old Lord Mori?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, it is so, it is so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Then, my lady, be comforted. Mayhap I shall find a solution to all our troubles</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Arising, gently she took her arms from about her aunt to hasten into the adjoining chamber. Her voice addressing the Madame Mume came to the Lady Evening Glory.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Tell my honorable father</q>, she said, <q>that I beg for just one minute of his honorable time</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When she returned to her aunt her face had a wan little smile of hope on it. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu followed her into the room. Wistaria prostrated herself before him with the utmost humility.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have asked for an audience, my lady. Speak quickly, for I have work to do ere long</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Honored parent</q>, said Wistaria, with her eyes upon his, <q>I have thought much upon what thou were pleased to tell me last night</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Indeed</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And, my father, the more I have thought of the matter the greater have the wrongs <pb n="128"/>of my father and mine, those of our house, appeared to me to be</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thou speakest now</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, quietly, <q>as becomes an honorable daughter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, my father, so deeply do I feel the wrongs of our house that I have felt that even the very death of this young prince would not be a sufficient vengeance</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She was speaking slowly and distinctly, so that each sentence should take effect upon her father.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Having broken the heart and spirit of my enemy</q>, said Shimadzu, <q>I shall have accomplished all. It will be sufficient, and my work, my duty, will then be consummated</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But think you, my father, that by the killing of his prince you will indeed have broken the heart and spirit of your enemy?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ay! For I shall have robbed him of that thing which he prizes above all else on earth—his son!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But has he not seven other sons who would quickly fill the place of this one?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is so. Were it possible for me to have seven instead of one Mori prince for execution this day, I would be seven times the happier</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>August father, you have taught me, and I have learned, that death is not the greatest of sorrows that can befall us. Execute this prince and he will quickly pass into another world, where the fates may befriend him. <pb n="129"/>He will be beyond our reach. In the eyes of his parent he will have died an heroic and exalted death, since he gives up his life for what he deems a noble cause. Oh, my father, in all the empire of Japan, what Imperialist would not envy him such a death? No, the death of this prince would be inadequate revenge for the wrongs we have suffered. Far better if he could be forced to live so that he might suffer the devils of pain to gnaw at his heart all the rest of his life</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thou wouldst have him spared for purposes of torture?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, honored father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thou art indeed a woman</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. <q>Yet a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>’s sword has never been turned to such a purpose</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is right, for your honorable sword is not sufficiently sharp, my father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thou speakest darkly, my daughter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have thought darkly of our wrongs, my father. I have found a more refined revenge to inflict upon this prince, one which would wound him more deeply than the death of one of his eight sons</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, and what is your revenge?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>First answer me this: What would be the feelings of this proud and arrogant prince if his idolized heir were to be guilty of that very fault for which he exiled his <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>?</q></p>
            <p><q>What fault?</q></p><pb n="130"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The fault of marrying into a degraded and outcast class</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> started. Then a strange smile flitted across his thin face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>His pride would fall. Such a calamity would crush—bend—kill him!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>True. Then if his pride is such, let us strike at it before his heart. I think I see a way by which this can be accomplished</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>How?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Bring this young prince hither. Leave him to me!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>To you!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She went very close to her father and raised her face upward so that he might see it perfectly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Look upon me, honorable parent. Am I not fair? Bring hither this son of an evil prince, and in twenty-four hours he will be ready to wed an 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>An 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden!</q> suddenly shrieked her aunt. <q>Who? Not—</q> She made an indescribable gesture towards the girl.</p>
            <p><q>I</q>, said Wistaria, throwing back her head—<q>I am an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden, my lady</q>. She bowed very low, then moved towards the door. Before passing out she turned.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I go</q>, she said, <q>to garb myself in the dress of an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden. But do not believe, my lady aunt, that I shall have lost that beauty with which the gods have blessed me, and with which I shall win and wed this Mori <pb n="131"/>prince to the disaster of his household and the triumph of my father’s</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With that she was gone from the room. They heard her light feet flying up to her chamber above.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It will crush—bend—kill the father!</q> muttered the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, softly. <q>It is well!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is well!</q> repeated his sister, but in a different tone.</p>

            <head>XV</head>
    
      
    
            <p>The young Prince of Mori, no longer the Shining Prince Keiki, lay huddled in a corner
                  of his dungeon. Vainly he had thrown his weight against the stone doors, only to
                  rebound, baffled and bruised. Vainly he had called in piercing accents for help.
                  There came no response from man or gods. Only his frantic voice, fleeing like the
                  wind through the passage-ways of the empty prison, dark, damp, and for long
                  unused, seemed to call back to him in the mocking tones of a demoniac.</p><pb n="133"/>
    
      
    
            <p>A prisoner! A prisoner! He, the heir of Mori, the hope, the idol of the brave Imperialists, the son of the most powerful prince in all Japan, barring not even the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> himself! A prisoner! Penned like a common criminal within the stone walls of a loathsome dungeon! It could not be true. It was a hideous nightmare, caused by that terrible, ceaseless, excruciating pain in his head, and the mad turmoil in his brain.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He had been captured on the outskirts of his father’s province. He was alone, with not one vassal or retainer in attendance upon him. He had made the wildest resistance. More than one <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> paid with his life for the capture of the Shining Prince. Overpowered by such numbers that it seemed madness not to yield, Keiki could not be taken while a spark of life remained in him with which to resist. Only when he was beaten quite senseless were the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s officers and the Catzu <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> able to capture the Prince. Even then many of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> refused the inglorious task of carrying away the young Prince, who had fought against them with such desperate bravery. To drag his unconscious, bleeding, helpless body before his judges would be beneath the dignity of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. So the office was assigned to some of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s spies.</p>
            <p>When Keiki had returned to consciousness he was as one in a dull dream, a night-<pb n="134"/>mare,
                  wherein painful events wove a net about him from which he could not stir or move
                  to save himself.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The trial had been a brief one. A few questions, a multitude of proofs, irrefutable evidence, the testimony of some false <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> now become a <foreign xml:lang="ja">ronin</foreign>, a private statement by the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu—that was all. No word or question whatever was addressed to the prisoner, nor was he given the opportunity to speak in his own defense, had he been in a condition to do so. He stood between two guards, one on either side, while four others stood before him and a score at his back.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki was quite beyond understanding the proceedings, and only the Spartan will of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> lent to him that almost unnatural strength by which he stood stoutly upon his feet while his head swam. Out of a multitude of surging words and sentences only one word reached his ears and penetrated to his consciousness—</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Treason!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>And the word called up a haunting memory of a dark and stagnant moat wherein the
                  sacred lotus blossoms, symbolic of the purity of woman, hid the treacherous waters
                  beneath, of a sloping bank where the grasses grew high over his head, and the
                  willows at the bottom waved in a foot of water. A young girl’s face shone out of
                  this strangely mixed <pb n="135"/>background. It was very long ago, it seemed to
                  Keiki, and though her face was quite dim to his vision now, he remembered that it
                  was like unto the lotus, perfectly pure and peerlessly beautiful, only behind her
                  beauty, unlike that of the lotus, there were no treacherous deeps of darkling
                  waters. Keiki remembered vaguely now that she had crawled through the willows,
                  through the moat, perhaps, to come to him to warn him of this treason. Treason?
                  Whose?</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Thus Keiki’s tangled mind followed not the mockery of the trial, nor heeded the sonorous voice of the crier, who echoed the words of the Lord Judge, and shouted mechanically:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Guilty! Death!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>A small company of armed men led him from the judgment-hall. They made a long journey, matching by night. Passive, stupidly indifferent to everything, Keiki was led to prison.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Only when they had locked him within the empty stone cell, did the old, passionate
                  rebellion that had swayed him so savagely when he had resisted capture break out
                  with renewed fury, driving in a flash his apathetic dulness from him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>His captors had taken his two swords from him, the two proud swords from which a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> must never part. The Prince was to be come lord over the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, yet he had been trained in the same school, and with as <pb n="136"/>severe a discipline as that of the simple soldier. Had they left him these, his <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> swords, in all probability the Prince would have ended his misery. As it was, he spent the night in fruitless, impotent raving. Morning found him exhausted. Even the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>’s great power of will over the physical body could avail him no longer.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu unlocked the door of the
                  cell no desperate, wild-eyed prince leaped at his throat. The young Prince of Mori
                  lay stretched across the floor of the dungeon. The glittering cords of his coat,
                  the golden hip-cape, with its billowings and embroiderings of dragons and falcons,
                  all the late luxurious finery which had earned for him the sobriquet of <q>The
                     Shining Prince</q>, and which were also the insignia of his high rank, were now
                  torn and stained with the cruellest of colors. The dark hair fell back, clotted
                  with the perspiration on his noble brow, from which the blue veins started through
                  the fine skin. The long lashes covered the eyes and swept the almost boyish curves
                  of the death-white cheeks. His lips were parted, and he was still raving, but in
                  the babbling, weak, piteous fashion of one delirious from loss of blood.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>After feeling the Prince’s hands and head, Shimadzu was satisfied with his condition. Roughly binding up a bad wound upon the shoulder, he called for a stretcher. Borne <pb n="137"/>upon this temporary couch, straightway the Prince was carried to the home of the executioner.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Meanwhile Wistaria had made ready for the reception of their expected guest. Having taken off her silken <foreign xml:lang="ja">omeshi</foreign> and removed the jeweled ornaments from her hair, she appeared in a rough cotton <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign>, of a bright red-and-yellow pattern, such a garment as a laboring woman or one of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">heimin</foreign> would have worn. But she had taken especial pains with her hair and face. The shining, dark locks, which formed such a charming frame for her beautiful face, were spread wide and folded back, so that their beauty might be exaggerated. Because she was pale, as one about to die rather than to wed, she had rubbed upon her cheeks, chin and brow brazen red paint, something previously she would have scorned to touch. Instead of brightening the pallof her face, however, it only heightened its haggardness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria sat in the centre of the chill, empty guest-room. She was smiling. She had been smiling ever since she had descended from her chamber. Her eyes were glassy, and shared not in that forced, blighting smile which she wore upon her lips. Very still, like an automatic puppet with the works unwound within it, she sat.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Lady Evening Glory, on the other hand, flitted back and forth like a restless <pb n="138"/>spirit. Sometimes she paused by the little, waiting figure, stroking
                  the shining head. But in her heart the proud Lady of Catzu had little sympathy for
                  the one who was to be sacrificed to the vengeance of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. When she recalled that her niece was renouncing her lover
                  to whom she had pledged herself to all eternity, she thought, with the selfish
                  egotism of one who has outgrown her own heart, that in marrying a prince, even
                  though she won him by trickery, certainly her niece would be faring better than if
                  she had bestowed herself on one of his vassals.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then, too, Wistaria, after all, was merely a female—an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden. So the lady’s selfish mind fed itself upon one thought, mingled hope and suspense for the fate of her son.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When the sound of tramping feet were heard without, the Lady Wistaria did not stir,
                  but the cold and stately Lady of Catzu went rushing across the room to fling
                  herself against the window. The tramp of feet grew louder, deeper, heavier. They
                  smote upon Wistaria’s ears like the beat of <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shinto</foreign> drums at a funeral. Still she did not stir, not even when the
                  doors of the house were pushed wide apart and the tramping feet entered, passed
                  through the outer room, and then into the guest-room. The set smile upon her face
                  deepened. Wistaria laid her head to the mats, prostrated herself in exquisite,
                  humble greeting.</p><pb n="139"/>
    
      
    
            <p>Thus, for some time, she courtesied low.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Some one pulled her sleeve. She sat up and stared at the figure on the stretcher. They had set it down beside her on the floor. Somewhere in another part of the house she heard dim voices, above them all her father’s deep, hollow voice, sounding strange—clear.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A sort of awe and horrible reverence fell upon her as she clutched her aunt’s hand. Then the two half crept, half crawled, close to the stretcher. Wistaria looked at the face, looked, and looked, and looked again. A heart-rending shriek burst from her lips. She fell across her lover’s body, spreading the wings of her sleeve over and about him, as though to shield and protect him from all harm.</p>

            <p><q>Brother, you were surely blind that you did not recognize your prisoner</q>, said the Lady Evening Glory, after the lovers had been carried from the room.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>His appearance, my lady, had no interest for me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Now that you are aware he is her lover, what then?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>All that is very fortunate. Whatever doubt I may have felt as to my daughter’s ability to ensnare this Mori prince into marrying her is now set at rest. She already possesses his affection. Nothing remains, therefore, to be done save to <pb n="141"/>bring about their early union. This shall be effected just as soon as the young man regains sufficient strength. Meanwhile—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Meanwhile?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have permission to despatch word to Choshui that a delay has been granted to
                     the Prince. This will keep them for a time from attacking Catzu Toro. Also, the
                        <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign>, availing itself of the time to
                     march upon Choshui, will rescue your son</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But will not the Mori immediately retaliate by sending troops here to attempt the rescue of their own prince?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Not so, since the whereabouts of their prince is entirely unknown to them. As you
                     are aware, his trial was in secret. Only the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign> is acquainted with his present abode. The secret will
                     be guarded, rest assured. In fact, for the very purpose of forestalling any
                     such attempt on the part of the Mori, they have placed at my service a company
                     of soldiers and large number of spies</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What are your intentions with regard to this Mori prince?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He shall marry, as you already know, the Lady Wistaria, and in that way will become an outcast, both legally and morally</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And after their marriage?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Immediate notification of the fact to his father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And after that? What of the order from the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign> touching his execution?</q></p><pb n="142"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It shall be destroyed. I have given my promise to my daughter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But when this fact reaches the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign> people
                     they will resent it, and will never permit so valuable a prisoner to escape
                     them. They will send troops, if necessary, to take him from you. In the event
                     of your refusing to execute him, they will find another who will do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well, let them do so. I have no doubt, however, that the Prince Keiki will escape them. But having become an outcast, he will be useless as an Imperialist leader</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Which does not alter the fact that the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>’s men will continue to fear him. Even now, you say, their spies and soldiers are lurking about on all sides. I tell you it is quite impossible for him to escape them now</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, all that is his affair, my lady. So far as I am concerned, on the day of his <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> marriage I shall destroy the order of execution</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Which would be a criminal act, and one that would place you under the ban of the law</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is true, but I shall answer, I assure you, for whatever unlawful acts I have committed during my lifetime to a higher tribunal than any that could be formed by the august shogunate</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Brother, what do your words imply?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Sister, I cannot answer that question yet. When my purpose in life is accomplished you <pb n="143"/>shall have the answer. And after that, will you perform a favor for me?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Certainly</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Lady Wistaria will be alone</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Alone? She will have a husband</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>She will be alone, I repeat. Do you suppose I should rest peacefully in my grave with the knowledge that the blood of Mori was mingling with my own? I repeat once more, my daughter will be quite alone, sister. Be gentle with her, and as tender and kind as it is possible for one woman to be to another. She will not lack for worldly wealth, for I shall leave her a fortune. I do not wish her to return to Catzu. I desire that a small temple shall be built for her somewhere in a quite and remote region. There I wish her to become a high priestess, to devote the remainder of her life to works of holiness and charity. In this way she will atone for the many sins of her father, and the gods will listen to her prayers and show charity to his soul</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Oh, brother, from your words I begin to have lamentable fears that you
                     contemplate committing some frightful harm to yourself</q>.</p>
               <p><q>We are children of the same father, my lady. Your words surprise me. Surely
                     they are unbefitting one of your blood and rank. Do you see any disgrace in my
                     contemplations? I would rather wish that you would <pb n="144"/>urge me to do that deed you
                     appear to dread, for otherwise my life would be without honor. Therefore lay
                     aside your unworthy fears and assure me that you will carry out my
                  wishes</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I shall do so, <foreign xml:lang="ja">ani-san</foreign></q> (elder brother),
                  she replied, somewhat brokenly.</p>
               <p><q>That is all, then. Why do you wait?</q></p>
               <p><q>For a letter signed by you as executioner, stating that the execution has been
                     postponed indefinitely. We must put Toro’s safety for the next few days beyond
                     a doubt</q>.</p>
               <p>Hastily writing a few words upon paper, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> handed it to his sister, who seized it eagerly. Then, having
                  examined the scroll carefully, she murmured a few words of thanks and prepared to
                  leave the room. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> stayed her.</p>
               <p><q>One moment. By whom do you send this paper to Choshui?</q></p>
               <p><q>I have two couriers</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Well, but one of those <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> must attend you
                     to Catzu</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Certainly</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Then only one can be sent to Choshui</q>.</p>
               <p><q>But why so? I shall not leave here until my couriers return with intelligence
                     as to the fate of my son</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I can assure you, my lady, that your couriers will not return, and I should
                     advise you to part with but one of the two <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> attending you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Why—?</q></p><pb n="145"/>
               <p><q>The Mori people will not let this courier depart, rest assured, unless he
                     divulge the hiding-place of their prince. This no <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> would ever do. If your courier has not the wit,
                     therefore, to deceive the Mori, I am very much afraid his life will be
                     endangered by this undertaking</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And what <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign></q>, inquired the lady,
                  quickly, <q>would not welcome the chance of thus giving up his life in the service
                     of his lord? What I have to decide now is, which of the two <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> to send, for each will claim the privilege
                     of the undertaking</q>.</p>
               <p><q>What are their names?</q></p>
               <p><q>Sir Nishimua Matsue and Sir Takemoto Genji. The former has been in my lord’s
                     service for twenty years, and is so trusted by him that whenever I am forced to
                     travel alone, as at the present time, my lord intrusts me to his especial care.
                     You are already acquainted with the history of the other, Sir Genji. He was one
                     of your own comrades in Choshui, but after your exile he deserted the Mori and
                     became a <foreign xml:lang="ja">ronin</foreign>. Afterwards my lord pressed him
                     into our service, and he became attached personally to Lady Wistaria. You will
                     see, therefore, that it is a difficult matter for me to choose between these
                     two brave gentlemen</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Not at all. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind as to which is the most
                     fit for the service. Bid the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji
                     come hither, if you please</q>.</p><pb n="146"/>
               <p>A few minutes later the big <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji and
                  Shimadzu were bowing deeply to each other. From their low bows of silent courtesy
                  it was hard to believe that these two men had once been the closest of friends and
                  comrades in arms. Now they met again after many years of separation, yet neither
                  exhibited that emotion which lay at the bottom of their hearts. Shimadzu did not
                  even allow opportunity for the usual exchange of compliments, but went straight to
                  the point.</p>
               <p><q>My good friend, your lady, my honorable sister</q>, said he, <q>has an august
                     mission for you to perform, but one fraught with exceeding great danger, and of
                     a delicate and diplomatic nature withal</q>.</p>
               <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> bowed calmly, as though the fact of
                  the danger were as indifferent a matter to him as the mission itself.</p>
               <p><q>In fact, she wishes you to carry word to Choshui of the postponement of Prince
                     Keiki’s execution. I need not point out to you the dangers of such a mission.
                     The Mori will insist upon your revealing the place of imprisonment of their
                     prince, and upon your refusing to do so will take drastic measures to compel
                     you. These perils, however, will be to your liking, I am sure</q>.</p>
               <p><q>To my liking, that is so</q>, said Genji, <q>but—</q></p>
               <p><q>What?</q> interrupted the Lady Evening <pb n="147"/>Glory. <q>You hesitate! You do not set
                     off at once!</q></p>
               <p><q>I do not hesitate, my lady</q>, replied the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, bowing respectfully. <q>I refuse. I do not set off at once
                     because I am not going</q>.</p>
               <p>The Lady Evening Glory could scarcely believe her ears. Never in her memory had a
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> refused to do the bidding of his lord
                  or lady. That Genji, of all <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, should do
                  so, astounded her. Nevertheless she brought herself to listen to his amazing
                  words.</p>
               <p><q>My lady, long before I entered the service of my Lord of Catzu I was a <foreign xml:lang="ja">ronin</foreign>, an independent <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> who owed allegiance to no lord or prince. I was induced
                     to enter your service not for love of your lord or desire to ingratiate myself
                     with the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> powers, for, though a deserter
                     of personal reasons, I was of the clan of Choshui, and an Imperialist at
                     heart!</q></p>
               <p><q>Such insolence</q>, said the lady, furiously, <q>shall be punished with thy
                     insignificant head</q>.</p>
               <p><q>Tsh!</q> interposed her brother, angrily. <q>Permit our good friend to speak. I
                     have a liking and understanding for his words</q>.</p>
               <p><q>As I have said</q>, repeated Genji, <q>it was neither for love of thy lord nor
                     his cause that I entered his service, but because I desired to be near to, and
                     to serve with my life, if necessary, the orphaned daughter of my old friend and
                     comrade, the Lady Wistaria</q>.</p><pb n="148"/>
               <p><q>It is well</q>, said the Lady Evening Glory, sharply, <q>that you did not
                     acquaint my Lord Catzu with all this. If my memory serves me correctly, you
                     came to Catzu with great protestations and promises of allegiance and loyalty
                     to his lordship</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And</q>, said Genji, <q>during the time that I have served the Lord Catzu,
                     there has been no <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> whose allegiance has
                     been more unswerving than mine</q>.</p>
               <p><q>And yet</q>, said the lady, scornfully, <q>at the first test the allegiance you
                     boast of is found wanting</q>.</p>
               <p><q>I respectfully beg to call your attention, my lady, to the error and injustice
                     you commit in making such a remark. In following my inclination at the present
                     time I expect to be discharged by his lordship, or I shall submit my
                     resignation to him. Under the circumstances, I am once more a free <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, and, being out of service, I am at perfect
                     liberty to serve whom I please. Nevertheless I shall take delight in obeying
                     any commands you may be pleased to bestow when I am at liberty to do so. At
                     present I am not at liberty</q>.</p>
               <p><q>May I inquire</q>, she asked, with her cold eyes disdainfully fixed above his
                  head, <q>why you condescended to accompany me?</q></p>
               <p><q>Certainly. I had a fancy that you were about to set off for the place where the
                     Lady Wistaria might be residing. Consequently I besought you to permit me to
                     attend you. <pb n="149"/>What is more, I had reason to believe that the Lady Wistaria would
                     be in need of me. Hence, here I am, and here I remain, the gods
                  permitting</q>.</p>
               <p><q>If you suppose, Sir Genji, that by pretending zeal in behalf of my honorable
                     niece you can excuse your conduct towards those in whose service you rightfully
                     belong, you will soon discover your error, I assure you</q>.</p>
               <p><q>There I disagree with you</q>, interrupted Shimadzu, suddenly. <q>It is my
                     opinion that any old friend’s loyal zeal for the insignificant Lady Wistaria
                     excuses him from any seeming lapses in service to his lord, and in this I
                     believe the Lord of Catzu will agree with me. Therefore, sister, let us call a
                     truce to this harsh and useless exchange of bitter words. Instead, let us beg
                     that Sir Genji will condescend to accept our gratitude for his loyalty to one
                     who, though insignificant, is yet of our family</q>.</p>
               <p>Again the two <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> bowed deeply to each other.
                  The Lady of Catzu shrugged angry shoulders.</p>
               <p><q>What is to be done?</q> she inquired, after a moment.</p>
               <p><q>Despatch the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Matsue at once with the
                     paper</q>, said her brother. <q>Meanwhile</q>—he turned to Genji—<q>deign to
                     permit me to lead you to my Lady Wistaria</q>.</p>

            <p>The pain was quite gone from the brain and head. The fever had abated. A strange sense of coolness and rest pervaded the whole being of Keiki. The Shining Prince fell to dreaming, this time without a hideous nightmare being wrought upon his mind.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Once more he was standing in a royal garden, where the little winds blew about him laden with the faint, subtle odor of early spring; where the birds clattered and cried out indignantly at him for disturbing them so early; where <pb n="151"/>the sun arose from behind the mountains veiled in a golden cloud and traveled over the heavens, pausing to tint the waters of a slender river to the magic glow of blood and gold. The soft, glad winds caressed as they called to him now. Moved to bend the knee in greeting and homage, he had become a sun-worshipper. He stood waiting beneath a flowered casement, waiting in a silence pregnant with inward feeling. Not a sound stirred about him; the birds had dropped to sleep again; but the glory of the sun had deepened and spread its full radiance upon the casement. Then very slowly a maiden’s face, like a picture of the sun-goddess with the halo of the sun about it, grew into the vision, until gradually the dream-eyes of the Prince Keiki saw naught else save that haunting spiritual face, with its eyes laden with love and still suffused with unutterable sadness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As suddenly as it had come, the vision faded away. Darkness passed between him and the face of his dreams. He sat upon his couch, stretching out imploring, beseeching hands as he called aloud, with a cry of piercing pleading:</p>
    
      
    
          <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Fuji—Fuji-wara</foreign>!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then he became dreamily conscious that soft hands were gently pushing him backward.
                  He knew that her arms were pressed about him, that she had put her face against
                     <pb n="152"/>his own. He tried to speak, but she closed his lips with her her
                  own upon them, and answered, in that sighing voice of hers:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is I, Wistaria! Pray thee to sleep!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki fell into a delicious, dreamless slumber. Beside him, her arms supporting against her bosom the weight of his head, Wistaria knelt, unmoving, for the space of an hour. Her eyes had that strange, brooding, guarding expression of the mother.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Some one tapped with the lightness of a child upon the <foreign xml:lang="ja">fusuma</foreign>. Wistaria tightened her arms about her love. Her face became strained and rigid. Her eyes enlarged with mingled terror and savage defiance.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The tapping was repeated. Still she made no response. There was an interval of silence. Then the sliding door was softly pushed aside. Some one entered the room, and stood against the wall looking down at the little, silent figure with its face of appealing, helpless agony. The next moment the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji was kneeling beside Wistaria.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>For a moment she could not speak, so intense were her mingled emotions. She had
                  thought herself bereft of all friends on earth. In her father and aunt she could
                  see nothing but menacing enemies who had assumed the dark guise of fiends. Yet
                  here was Genji—Genji, her own, big <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>—whose
                  very presence brought a sense of safety and re-<pb n="153"/>pose. A strange little laugh, half
                  a strangled sob, struggled through her lips.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In one glance Genji saw that the weight of the Prince in her slender arms was benumbing them. Without a word he lifted the sleeping Prince in his own arms and put him gently back upon the padded robe which served as his couch. Then turning to his mistress he half assisted her, half lifted her, to her feet. For a moment she leaned against him, dizzy with weakness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In a broken, piteous, helpless fashion she began to cry against his breast, the pent-up anguish of many days finding its outlet.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Genji gently led her across the room, beyond the possible awakening of the Prince. His big voice, hushed to a whisper despite its huskiness, was as soothing as a mother’s.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Aré moshi</foreign>! See, the big Gen is here. All is well!
                     Very well!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, Gen!</q> she sobbed. <q>I do not know what to do!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do? Why, we must cease to weep, so we may have the strength to minister to the sick</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Y-yes—I will cease to weep</q>, she whispered, brokenly. <q>I—I will do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is right</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And you will not let them harm him, will you, Gen?</q></p>
            <p><q>No! I swear by my sword I will not!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are so good and strong, Gen!</q></p><pb n="154"/>
    
      
    
            <p>Placing his hands upon her shoulders he held her back, then gently wiped the tears from her face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Hah!</q> he cried. <q>Now she is once again the brave girl. That is right. She is the daughter of a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, and cannot weep for long</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She tried to smile through her tears, but it was a very pitiful little smile which struggled through the mist.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Now</q>, said he, <q>tell me everything</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do you not know all?</q> she asked.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, I do not. I am in darkness as to how your lover comes to be here, wounded and ill; but I surmise that he was captured while on his way to Choshui and prevented from warning his prince</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You do not know</q>, cried Wistaria, looking up into his face with startled eyes, <q>that he is the prince himself?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The prince! Who is the prince? What prince?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The young Prince of Mori. He</q>—she indicated Keiki—<q>he is the same person</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>It was Genji’s turn to start. He made a movement towards the Prince, but Wistaria grasped his arm and stayed him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, do not go to him. He is so tired, Gen. He has been awake, though unconscious, all night long, and he needs the honorable rest the gods have denied him so long</q>.</p><pb n="155"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But you do not mean to tell me that your lover is the young Mori prince?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, even so, Gen, though I knew it not until—until they brought him here</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Brought him here! Why—but this man—the Prince Mori is condemned to death! He was found guilty of treason—he—oh, it is quite impossible!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Alas! but it is true</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You do not mean that your father brought him here under penalty of death?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Her head was bent forward. She covered her face with her sleeve.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Shaka!</q> exclaimed Genji. <q>We must do something at once</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, oh yes! You, Gen, you will take him away—will you not, Gen?—and protect him, for if you do not they will kill him, or force me to marry with him</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Force you to marry with him!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes. Do you not understand? I am only an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> girl</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I know that</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And my father believes that if he were to marry me to the Prince he would legally become an outcast, and it would break his father’s heart</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is very true</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Then you see, Gen, how imperative it is that he should be taken away at once</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why, no, I do not so regard it</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You do not? Then what am I to do?</q></p><pb n="156"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Marry him at once</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But, indeed, I cannot do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why not?</q></p>
            <p><q>Oh, Gen, it would be too humiliating for him to debase himself. I could not be so false as to deceive him and drag him down from his high estate. I could not do it</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Pugh! You overrate the ignominy of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>. In the old days when your father married among them the prejudice was at its bitterest. He is not aware of the changes which are rapidly taking place in the thought of the people of Japan to-day, nor does he know that this very prince represents to the people that new era which is about to dawn wherein all men will have equal rights and privileges. Your honorable father has lived only in his own sorrows, knowing little of what is taking place in his country. Take advantage of his ignorance, I advise you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But he would never forgive me</q>, she said.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Who? Your prince? Never forgive you for marrying him! Why, I thought he had wooed you for that purpose!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes</q>, she sighed, <q>but he did not know the truth then. Perhaps if he had known of my lowly station—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It would have made no difference. I tell you I am well acquainted with this family
                     of Mori. They are a proud but not ignoble race, and this new scion has shown a
                     braver <pb n="157"/>and better blood than all of his august ancestors</q>.</p>
            <p><q>I cannot do it</q>, she said, shaking her head despairingly. <q>So do you, pray, Sir Gen, assist me to put him in hiding somewhere</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Tsh! That is impossible. Why, see, he is a big fellow. We could not carry him far, and the place here is surrounded by spies. He would meet a worse fate than if—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She became paler and shivered visibly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not like to hear you speak so</q>, she said.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not like to see you act so, my lady</q>, said Gen. <q>What! You would desert your lover when he most needs you!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, Gen, no! I did not say that</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>When there is a way by which you can save his life, you refuse to do so? Very well, then; better deliver him up at once to his executioners</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh-h!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She interrupted him with a sharp cry of fright. The sound of her voice reaching the Prince as he slept, he turned uneasily on his couch, sighing heavily. Genji and Wistaria listened to him in breathless silence. Then, with her face turned towards the Prince, Wistaria moved close to his couch, whispering tremulously:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, yes, I must do it. It is the only way—the only way!</q></p><pb n="158"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is right</q>, said Genji, patting her hand reassuringly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She walked unsteadily back to her lover. Once more she sank down on her knees beside him. Her face wore an expression the big <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> could not bear to look upon. He moved very silently and stood against the door of the chamber, straight and immovable as a statue, and strong and invinciple as a war god on guard.</p>
    </div>
            <pb n="159"/>
    <div type="chapter" n="18">                        
      
    
            <head>XVIII</head>
    
      
    
            <p>Prince Keiki was pacing restlessly and impatiently up and down the chamber wherein he had lain ill. It was the month of June. From the small opening of the doors Keiki could see that the uneven hillocks which appeared on all sides were blazing with the gorgeous flowers colored by the yellow sun above them.</p>
    
      
    
       <p>At the door of the chamber, his arms folded across his breast, his eyes quietly following the glance of the plainly irritated Prince, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji stood, still in the attitude of a guard.</p><pb n="160"/>
            <p><q>Why</q>, inquired the Prince, frowning savagely, <q>may not the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> be pushed completely to one side? I suppose this honorable house is fashioned like any other Japanese abode. Since I am not permitted to venture out of this honorable interior, at least I might be allowed to look upon more of the outside world than is to be seen through such a narrow space</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He indicated the screens, only partially opened, which half discovered, half concealed, a sloping balcony.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Very deep and respectful was Genji’s bow.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is my distasteful duty to be forced to disagree with your excellency</q>, he said. <q>Your highness’s august health is such that your chamber must be sheltered even from the summer breezes</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince stopped sharply in his walk.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Spare yourself such imaginative effort, Sir Genji</q>, he said. <q>That, you are well aware, is not the true reason why I am deprived of sufficient air, and am forced to remain in a room with my shutters closed so that not even the breath of summer may enter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>At Genji’s second obeisance, the Prince, with an impatient motion, commanded him to
                  cease, and to give his undivided attention to his remarks.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Now will you do me the kindness to inform me what all these mysterious
                     precau-<pb n="161"/>tions mean? Wait a moment. Do not speak, for I perceive you are about to
                     utter some further prevarication. Think before you speak, and try to see that
                     it is useless to attempt to deceive me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, my lord</q>, said Genji, <q>knowing as you do the peril in which your life will be placed if—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh yes, I perceive all you would say. I have recently been rescued from a blood-thirsty executioner; I must remain in hiding for some time, and so on; but what I wish to understand is why is it necessary for me to continue imprisoned?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, my lord, you would not wish a <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> spy to catch a glimpse of you by chance?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I fear no spy</q>, said the Prince, with contempt. <q>If I were permitted my own way</q>, he added, savagely, <q>I would not linger here, but would start out alone, and cut my way through such worms and vipers</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>If you wish to do so</q>, said Genji, with some asperity, <q>I shall take no measures to prevent you; but I had thought your highness desired to remain here at all events until after your wedding</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The young Prince sighed, and, seating himself on a small lacquer stool by the parted doors, he rested his chin upon his hands and stared out gloomily at the landscape.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>After a moment, in a gentler voice he rejoined:</p><pb n="162"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Is it not yet time for her to come?</q> without turning his head.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince sighed again.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I once prided myself upon my habit of early rising</q>, he said. <q>Now it has become a nuisance</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Silence again, and then:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Sir Genji, what has become of the Lady Evening Glory? She has not returned to Catzu?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No. She still condescends to accept my humble hospitality</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have not seen her lately—a fortunate circumstance, by-the-way. The lady oppresses me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>She has been much engaged with the marriage garments of the Lady Wistaria</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince’s face softened at the mere mention of Wistaria’s name, and the look of impatience passed from his face. For a time he seemed plunged in a pleasing reverie. Again he questioned the 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do you not think it a strange fancy for my lady to wish to be married here at your house instead of at Catzu?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Not at all. Your health is such that an ordinary wedding would be harmful; besides, think of the danger!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, it is my opinion that the state of my health is exaggerated. All I need to drive away my paleness quickly is the open air <pb n="163"/>and the golden sunlight. As for the danger, I was not thinking of a wedding in Catzu, but one in my own province. I should be perfectly safe there with my own <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> to protect me, and a half-dozen other southern clans ready to come to my assistance</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I cannot conceive of your excellency’s impatience and dissatisfaction</q>, said Genji, <q>when I recall that you are about to be wedded soon, and to one for whom any prince would be only too glad to sacrifice everything</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are right, Sir Genji. Yet is it not strange that, despite all this, I feel melancholy. I cannot understand it</q>. He paused, and turned on his seat to look back at the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. <q>Sometimes it appears to me that I have caught this sadness of spirit from my lady herself</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What, the Lady Wistaria? Impossible</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is true</q>, said the Prince, thoughtfully.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why, she sings half the day like a bird—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Whose heart is broken</q>, quickly ended the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>She plays like a child—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Who is commanded to rejoice</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Her soul is as gay—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>As a priestess whom the black temple shuts from life</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Pugh! She laughs—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>With tears in her throat;</q> again the Prince finished the sentence. <q>Yes, it is so, I tell you. I am not deceived</q>.</p><pb n="164"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your affection, my lord, causes you to imagine things that do not exist</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, my affection but increases the acuteness of my perceptions</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>If you will permit an unworthy vassal to venture an opinion, I would say, my lord, that for one about to wed in a day, your excellency wears a most funereal countenance</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince arose abruptly, as though he would shake off some oppression that beset him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Let me tell you, my good fellow</q>, he said, approaching Genji more closely, <q>when one we love appears to us to be cloaking behind a mask of painful gayety some secret sadness, the world is apt to wear a haggard aspect which one’s own self must reflect. If you repeat that my imagination but conjures up such fancies, then I will say that I must be insane</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Silently, for the space of a few moments, the two men remained looking into each other’s faces. They started simultaneously at the soft patting of approaching footsteps.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>One request, Sir Genji</q>, whispered Keiki, as the footsteps drew nearer. <q>Will
                     you for once relax your guard and permit me to be alone with—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You can guard my person just as well outside, and should any one attempt to attack me you will certainly be made aware of the <pb n="165"/>fact by whatever noise a pair of lungs can force</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Her aunt would consider it unseemly</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, with some hesitation.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not make it a request</q>, said the Prince, patiently, <q>but merely beg the favor</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A light tap on the door, and the next moment Wistaria had entered the room. Her arms were full of flowers, flaming red and yellow blossoms that grew wild on the hills, while about her garments clung the odors of the fields and the mountain. She was damp and sweet with the morning dew shining on her hair, clinging even to her face and arms.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What!</q> cried Gen. <q>You have been out already?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She nodded, smiling wistfully over the flowers, which the Prince silently took from her arms and set upon the floor. His eyes never relaxed their gaze from her sweet face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord’s chamber</q>, she said, as she shook the dew and a few clinging leaves from her <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign>, <q>is so barren of the beauty of summer that I thought the fields might spare something of their wealth</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki turned an imploring glance to Genji. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> turned hastily to the door.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, then</q>, said Genji, <q>I shall go and bring you some honorable water for
                     the flowers</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The moment Genji had left the room the Prince seized Wistaria’s hands impulsively.</p><pb n="166"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Wistaria</q>, he cried, <q>now I have some questions to put to you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>One startled, upward glance at him she gave. He took her face in his hands, compelling her eyes to meet his own.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why are your eyes so dark?</q> he asked.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She attempted to smile.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The gods—</q> she began.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No</q>, he interrupted, knowing in advance what she was about to say, <q>but here, and here</q>. He passed his fingers gently over the dark shadows that framed the pitiful eyes.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Have they not always been so?</q> she asked, with a pathetic attempt at lightness which did not deceive him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No</q>, he replied, almost vehemently. <q>When first the gods blessed me with the joy of beholding you, they were not so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well</q>, she murmured, tremulously. <q>I am becoming honorably older. That is all</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, that is not the reason</q>, he cried, passionately. <q>A few months could not have wrought the difference, nor the other changes I perceive in your face. The rose is gone. You are pale and too frail. Your lips—ah, I cannot bear it!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>With an exclamation of pain he broke off.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>An expression of fright appeared in her face. Her hands clutched about his.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, she cried, <q>you—you do not think that I—that I have ceased to be beautiful?</q></p><pb n="167"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, no. You are more beautiful than ever. You could not be otherwise than beautiful, my beloved, but you appear to me so frail that I am beginning to believe you are some spirit. Tell me, do tell me, what has wrought this change in you?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>For a moment she remained silent. Then she laughed. Her hands, with a little, childish motion of delight, she clapped.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Wait!</q> she cried, breaking from his arm. <q>I will show you the cause</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She ran across the room and brought a little mirror, which she polished with her sleeve as she returned to him. Then leaning against him, she held it before his face, while she put her own cheek against his.</p>
    
      
    
       <p><q>Look within, Keiki-<foreign xml:lang="ja">sama</foreign>. Said the gods: ‘Such a pale and wan Keiki will need a companion, so we will make the Lady Wistaria’s face to match his!’ So they did so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With a gesture of despair, he pushed the glass away.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No</q>, he said, hoarsely, <q>for mine is pale and thin from much illness, while
                     yours—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>From love</q>, she said, in a breath.</p>

            <head>XIX</head>
    
      
    
       <p><q>Wistaria</q>, said the Prince Keiki, with a very firm clasp of her hand, <q>just now I
                     insisted that the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji should cease
                     his futile deception by useless prevarication. And now I ask you, I beg you,
                     not to hide under a cloak of levity any secret trouble which you may have, and
                     which I, as your future husband, am entitled to know</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The mirror slipped from the girl’s hand. She stared at it hopelessly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Now answer me</q>, continued her lover, insistently. <q>Is it not true that you are in trouble?</q></p><pb n="169"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes</q>, she said, in a low voice; <q>yes, but—</q> Her voice broke, and she turned her face from his gaze. <q>But, alas, I cannot tell it to you, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, do so</q>, he entreated, with such pleading in his voice that she came back to his arms and nestled against his breast with a little wounded cry.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am waiting</q>, he said, softly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I cannot tell you</q>, she murmured against his breast.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why not?</q> he inquired, quietly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In her nervous restlessness she broke away from his arms again. Her hands noiselessly clapped each other repeatedly. She could not remain still.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why not?</q> repeated the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>There are many reasons</q>, she said, in a low voice, still maintaining the distance between them.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, think a little while, and see whether your heart will not suggest to you that the mere telling of your troubles to me may be their solution. Remember I shall be your honorable husband very soon</q>—he smiled a trifle sadly—<q>and then I shall command you to tell me the truth, you know</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria sat very still now. Ever since Genji had come upon her that first day with
                  the wounded Prince in her arms Wistaria had been a prey to the utmost despair and
                  anguish. The infinite faith and trust of <pb n="170"/>her lover filled her
                  continually with a greater horror of her deceit, for she could not forget, not for
                  one moment, the part she had been forced to play in the undoing of the Prince. How
                  could she add to her other iniquities by inveigling this noble and
                  generous-hearted Prince into a marriage which would not fail to debase him? And
                  yet she had no alternative, for otherwise his life would be the forfeit. Was it
                  possible for her to tell him all this? Would it be, as he had said, a solution of
                  her misery to confess her own deceit and warn him of the danger in which he stood,
                  that of marrying into an outcast family?</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As she thought thus sadly, the gentle voice of her lover brought the tears to her eyes. But she held them back, almost feverishly placing a greater distance between herself and the Prince. In that moment when his tender eyes held hers in their gaze, while he trustfully waited for her to speak, she was ready to tell him everything.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are about to tell me all</q>, he said, as though he understood her unspoken volition. <q>Do not mistrust me. Believe in my adoration for you. Give me thy heart completely</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A sudden shivering took possession of Wistaria. Instead of speaking, she drew her sleeve across her face, a characteristic habit with her when in despair. Gradually her head sank forward, until she knelt at his feet in an attitude of humility.</p><pb n="171"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, do not kneel</q>, he cried, <q>nor hide thy face from me. Do not so, I beseech thee</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Having permitted his assistance in rising, she freed herself from his encircling arm.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Look at me, my lord</q>, she cried. <q>Tell me, what do you see?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>A maiden as beautiful as the sun-goddess and as good—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, then, do not speak so. Look at me again, my lord. Have you then found such pleasure in my beauty that you have not even remarked my garments?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your garments?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Bewilderment was in his face.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes. Are these the silks, my lord, worn by the ladies of your rank?</q></p>
    
      
    
       <p><q>Nay, but though I cannot conceive why you should be garbed in cotton, yet I see no disgrace in the fact. Perchance the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji is honorably poor, and you are so courteous as to dress in homely garments while a guest of his honorable household</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am not a guest of his household, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I know it has been told you so. Nevertheless, this is the house of my father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not understand</q>, he exclaimed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He added immediately, <q>If it is that your honorable father is poor—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are wrong, my lord. My father is <pb n="172"/>in the service of the government. His remuneration is ample</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Then do explain to me the reason why you are so garbed and situated</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Because it is so enacted by the law</q>, she said. </p>
               <p><q>The law!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> woman</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>An <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign>! Impossible!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That was the offense for which my father was banished—because of his marriage to an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> maiden</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince stared at her aghast. She stood still as if made of stone. Her lover’s
                  silence was due to his repugnance at this revelation, she thought. Seeing his
                  effort to speak, she prayed a little prayer to the gods that he would spare her.
                  The Prince found his voice.</p>
    
    
            <p><q>Then by the royal blood of my ancestors, I swear</q>, he cried, <q>that I shall be
                     guilty of the same offense as thy honorable parent, and for thy sweet sake I,
                     too, shall become an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign></q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With a little, trembling cry she started towards him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But thy cause! Oh, my lord, thy noble cause!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The cause!</q> He threw back his head and laughed with buoyant joyousness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Fuji-wara</foreign></q>, he said, <q>do you not perceive
                     that a new life is about to dawn for this Japan of ours?</q></p><pb n="173"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>A new life</q>, she repeated, breathlessly, hanging upon the words that escaped his lips.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>A new life</q>, he said, <q>with our country no longer broken up into factions, when men shall have equal rights and privileges</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He smiled at her rapt face, and possessed himself of both her little hands.</p>
    
      
    
       <p><q>Dearest and sweetest of maidens</q>, he said, tenderly, <q>in marrying me you do not wed a prince. I am pledged to the welfare of the people. Know you not that the great cause of the Imperialist will bring about that Restoration which will overturn all these crushing tyrannies and injustices which press our people to the earth? Repeat with me, then: ‘<foreign xml:lang="ja">Daigi Meibunor</foreign>! <foreign xml:lang="ja">Banzai</foreign> the Imperialist!’</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Suddenly she remembered the blow she had dealt the cause. Her head fell upon their clasped hands.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>But over her fallen head the voice of the Prince Keiki was full of joy.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And now I have heard the great trouble, and have I not burst it like a bubble?
                     Henceforward, then, let there be only happiness and joy in these eyes and these
                     lips</q>. Reverently he pressed her eyes and lips.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Genji was heard outside the door. His face was very grave and his whole appearance perturbed when he entered.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Bowing deeply to the Prince, he addressed him hastily:</p><pb n="174"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your excellency, the Lord of Catzu has arrived at my insignificant house and is
                     below. It is his wish that the marriage of his niece should be celebrated
                     without further delay. I come to you, therefore, to beg that you will consent
                     to its immediate consummation</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I comply with gladness</q>, replied the Prince, <q>but may I inquire the reason for this haste?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Lord Catzu Toro is in critical peril in your august father’s province</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Enough!</q> interrupted the Prince, impulsively. <q>You desire my immediate mediation in his behalf?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>He turned to Wistaria with an exclamation of delight. <q>Now</q>, said he, <q>we shall see all our troubles melt into thin air like mist before the sun</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But I have not told you all—there is more still to tell. I pray you—</q> Wistaria began.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>There is no time</q>, interrupted Genji, severely, <q>and I beg your highness will convince the Lady Wistaria of the necessity for haste</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is right</q>, said the Prince. <q>There is a whole lifetime before us yet in which thou canst tell me thy heart. Come. Let us descend to the wedding-chamber</q>.</p>

            <p>No Prince of Japan had ever been wedded in so strange and lowly a fashion. There was not a sign or sound of the gratulation, rejoicing, or pomp which usually attend such ceremonies. When the Prince Keiki and the Lady Wistaria, attended by the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji, entered the homely wedding apartment, they found a small group, pale and solemn, awaiting them. It consisted of the Lord and Lady Catzu and one who was a stranger to Keiki, but whom he knew to be the father of the Lady Wistaria.</p><pb n="176"/>
    
      
    
            <p>The waiting party bowed very low and solemnly to those who had just entered. Their greeting was returned with an equal gravity and grace. There was a pause—a hush. Keiki looked about him inquiringly, and then he shivered. The true solemnity of the occasion dawned upon him so that even the near joy of possessing Wistaria at last passed from his mind. He was about to join through marriage two families who hitherto had had for each other nothing save hatred and detestation.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Timid and pale as his glance was, he scarcely dared to look at the Lady Wistaria, though he knew she was so weak and faint that the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji had to support her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Somewhat sharply, the voice of the Lady Evening Glory broke the silence.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why do we wait?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Lord Catzu stirred uneasily, glancing from the bridal couple to his wife, and then to the inscrutable face of Shimadzu.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>If I may be permitted to remark</q>, he said, apologetically, <q>the Lady Wistaria is certainly garbed unbefitting her rank and race</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Chut!</q> said his wife, angrily, <q>you would delay matters for such a trifle? Every moment counts now against our son. Will you let such an insignificant matter as the dress of your unworthy niece hasten the possible death of our beloved?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>When it is her wedding-dress, yes</q>, said <pb n="177"/>Catzu, stubbornly. <q>May I be stricken blind before I witness such a disgrace brought upon my honorable niece’s dignity. She must be married as befits her rank, I repeat</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A sour smile played over the features of the Lady Evening Glory.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is true. Well, her rank is that of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign></q>, she said, tartly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Having found the courage to disagree with his lady, Catzu now set her at complete defiance. He marched towards the door.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well, then. I refuse to witness such an outrageous ceremony. The lady may have <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> kindred, but do not forget that she has also the blood of royalty in her veins</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>His consort could hardly suppress her fury.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I appeal to you, honored brother</q>, she said. <q>How shall it be?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And I</q>, exploded Catzu, who was in an evil and contrary temper, <q>appeal to you, my Lord of Mori</q>, and he bowed profoundly to the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Shimadzu made no response. His glance met that of the troubled Prince. Keiki flushed under his penetrating eyes. Then he spoke with graceful dignity, bowing meanwhile to the trembling Wistaria.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Let her be garbed</q>, he said, <q>as befits the daughter of her father and the bride of a Prince of Mori</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>There was silence for a space. Then <pb n="178"/>Shimadzu made an imperative gesture to Genji, who gently led the girl from the chamber, followed by the angrily resigned Lady Evening Glory.</p>
    
      
    
    <p>The three men, now alone, waited in strained silence for Wistaria’s return. Straight and stiff, with heads somewhat bent to the floor, they remained standing in almost identical attitudes. Gradually, however, Catzu broke the tension by an attempt to relieve his excessive nervousness. Resting first on one foot and then on the other, he shifted about. His eyes lingered in painful sympathy upon the Prince, and then irresolutely turned to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. Perspiration stood out on the lord’s brow. He was suffering physically from the strain.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>After a long interval of this intolerable silence, the doors of the chamber were again pushed aside. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji entered. Bowing deeply, he announced:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Lady Wistaria and her august aunt enter the honorable chamber!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>The two ladies, close behind Genji, now followed him into the room. Immediately all prostrated themselves. When they had regained their feet, it was found that Wistaria was still kneeling. Then Genji perceived that she had not risen because she was unable to do so. Without a word, he lifted her to her feet. One moment she leaned against his strong arm, then seemed to gather strength. <pb n="179"/>Stepping apart from him, she stood alone there in the middle of the floor.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Despite her waxen whiteness, she was more than beautiful—ethereal. Her lacquer hair was no more dark than her strange, long eyes, both set off by an exquisite robe of ancient style, as befitted a lady of noble blood.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When her hand touched that of the Prince he felt cold as ice. Involuntarily his own
                  palm inclosed hers warmly. He did not let it go, but drawing her closer to him,
                  unmindful of the assembled company, he tried to fathom the tragedy that seemed to
                  lurk behind her impenetrable eyes. But, her head drooping above their hands, he
                  beheld only the sheen of her glossy hair. Then she passed from his side to her
                  uncle and father.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Almost mechanically, his eyes never once relaxing their gaze from the face of his
                  bride, the Prince went through the ceremony. After the service he tried to break
                  the uncomfortable restraint. He proposed the health of the two noble though
                  previously misguided families, whose union had now been so happily consummated.
                  But his own cup was the only one held high. Gradually his hand fell from its
                  elevation. He set the untasted <foreign xml:lang="ja">sake</foreign> down among
                  the marriage-cups and sprang to his feet.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Let us diffuse some merriment among us</q>, he cried, <q>for the sake of the gods
                     and for our future peace and happiness. Such un-<pb n="180"/>due solemnity bodes ill for our
                     honorable future</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu stepped forward, facing him fairly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord and prince</q>, he said, <q>I have this moment given the signal for a courier to hasten immediately to Choshui to acquaint my bitterest enemy with the tidings of the marriage of his heir to my insignificant daughter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince smiled, despite his uneasiness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Surely, my lord</q>, he said, <q>you make a goodly new and honorable custom. What! an announcement, perchance an invitation for one’s enemy! That is well, for we have overturned all false maxims relating to vengeance against an enemy. We have buried our wrongs in a union of love, and embrace our enemies as friends</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>With august humility</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>,
                  coldly, <q>I would suggest that your highness’s assurance of our embrace is
                     premature</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Premature! What, and this my marriage day!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your marriage day may be a source of woe to your proud house</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, that is so</q>, agreed the Prince, thoughtfully. <q>Nevertheless</q>, he added, cheerfully, <q>my honorable father becomes more lenient with the years. Moreover he has but to behold his new daughter to forget all else save the fortune the gods have bestowed upon us</q>.</p><pb n="181"/>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Be assured your father shall never behold her</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, with incisive fierceness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What is that?</q></p>
            <p><q>You have heard</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Bud I do assure you that my marriage, though it may provoke the momentary anger of my father, will never debar my lady wife from her position in our household. You forget that my honored parent is very old, and I shall soon have the honor of becoming Prince of Mori in my own right. I shall then have no lord to deprive me of my rights, even if I had disregarded the law</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You may as well be made aware of the fact at once</q>, said Shimadzu, <q>that no blood of mine shall ever mingle with that of the Mori!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not understand your honorable speech. Has not our august bloods just now become united?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Only by the law, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well--?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My daughter, your highness, shall never accompany her Mori husband to his home</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well, then. I will remain here with her. I am quite satisfied to renounce all my worldly ambitions and possessions for her sake, if such is the command of her august father</q>, and the Prince bowed to his father-in-law in the most filial and affable manner.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>If you remain here you will not be permitted to live</q>.</p><pb n="182"/>
    
      
    
            <p>A low cry, half moan, came from the new Princess of Mori, who lay against her uncle’s breast. Keiki turned to look at her at that cry. He was seized with a foreboding of events to come. Again he turned to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Will it pleas you, honored father-in-law, to speak more plainly to me?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well. This marriage, your highness, has been consummated not for the purpose of uniting a pair of lovers, but to fulfill a pledge which was made to one who was murdered by your parent—a pledge of vengeance</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But I cannot perceive how this is accomplished</q>, said the Prince, now pale as Wistaria.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have married an <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> girl</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am aware of that</q>, said the Prince, somewhat proudly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have not finished</q>, said Shimadzu, <q>Are you aware that you are at present under sentence of death?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince made a contemptuous motion.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>By order of the 
                  <foreign xml:lang="ja">bakufu</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign>). Yes, I am aware of the fact</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well. I am the executioner!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It was I who caused your arrest, and afterwards brought you hither with the intention of executing you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A flood of horrible thoughts rushed across the Prince’s mind, bewildering him. As if to press them back, he clasped his hand to his <pb n="183"/>head. Shimadzu continued in his cold and monotonous voice:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>After your arrest, it was brought to my attention that a more subtle revenge against your parent could be gained by marrying you into that very class of people so despised by your father, and forcing you to become guilty of the same offense for which I was exiled</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Stirred as he now was, Keiki’s faith in Wistaria remained unshaken. That her father had had a hand in betraying him he was assured, but he could not yet recognize in the deed the delicate hand of the woman he loved.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Through the agency of my daughter</q>, went on the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, <q>I was soon able to learn sufficient concerning the workings of the Imperialist party of which you are the head—</q></p>
            
            <p><q>The Imperialist party!</q> repeated the Prince, and he bounded towards the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> with the cry of a wounded animal. His hand sprang to his hip, where his sword had been restored to its sheath.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You—you!</q> he shouted. <q>It was you who betrayed me—who—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are augustly wrong</q>, said the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, moving not an inch, despite the close proximity and menacing attitude of the Prince. <q>You honorably betrayed yourself!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Certainly. To her</q>. He indicated, without naming, the Lady Wistaria.</p><pb n="184"/>
    
      
    
            <p>Slowly, painfully, driven by the goading words of the father, the blazing, burning eyes of the husband sought Wistaria, there to rest upon her while infinite horror found mirror in his countenance. Motionless thus he stood.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Wistaria, braced for a shock she could not meet, leaned against her uncle, whose head bent over her. The Lady Evening Glory smiled, as one who delights in the soul of a cat. Calm, satisfied, unmoved, remained Shimadzu. Keiki’s eyes bulged from their sockets, his mouth gaped open. At last one word burst from his lips, but it was as eloquent as though he had uttered a thousand.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thou!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Her hand sank low. He recoiled a step. But with entranced horror he continued to gaze at her. Her face was like marble, out of which her dark eyes stared as though made of polished, glazed china. And as he gazed, terrible thoughts and remembrances rushed upon Keiki, overpowering, weakening, paralyzing him. After a long, immovable silence he leaned slowly forward until their faces, close together, were on a level.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is true?</q> he whispered, hoarsely. <q>Speak! Speak!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is true</q>, she replied, in a voice so small and faint that it seemed far
                  away.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>His sword leaped out of his scabbard. He raised it as if to strike her down. But his <pb n="185"/>hand fell to his side. Then he spoke, in a hoarse, fearful voice:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The gods may forgive thee. I, never!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>With that he was gone from the chamber. They heard the clash of his sword as it touched the stone pavement, then the sound of his flying feet, loud at first, and then dying away into the silence.</p>

            <head>XXI</head>
    
      
    
            <p>Having fulfilled his purpose in life, the Shimadzu was ready, eager, for his own self-immolation. He had prepared for this event with strict observance of an elaborate etiquette, just as he, a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, would have prepared for any event of importance in his life.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The little house had been thoroughly cleansed and white-washed. Fresh mats of straw had been laid upon the floor, and the walls were recovered. To admit the sunshine, and the air of the out-door world, the windows were thrown wide apart.</p><pb n="187"/>
            <p>Shimadzu produced an ancient chest, from which he brought forth rare and costly old
                  garments, emblazoned with the crests of a proud family, and a pair of very long
                  swords. The hilts were of black lacquer. The guard, ferule, cleats, and rivets
                  were richly inlaid and embossed in rare metals. But the beautiful blades were the
                  parts which shone out in their noble, classic beauty. They were extremely narrow,
                  glossy, and brittle as icicles. The very sight of them would have awakened a
                  feeling of heroism and awe in the bosom of one less alive to what they signified
                  than Shimadzu. They were, in fact, two swords which, belonging to a hundred
                  ancestors of Shimadzu, had been used only in the most glorious service.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The girded sword is the soul of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign></q>, and Shimadzu muttered an ancient saying. It had been long since he lost the right to wear them through his marriage into the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> class, and now he regarded them with such intense emotion that fierce tears blinded his eyesight.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Reverently, tenderly, he lifted them to a place upon a white table before a shrine in his own chamber. Then with a low groan he prostrated himself before them, rather than the figure of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Daibutsu</foreign>, which placidly rested upon the small throne.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In his inmost soul, this <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> felt he had done a good and righteous thing in achieving <pb n="188"/>his vengeance, even though the innocent were sacrificed. Trained as he had been in the harsh school of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, in which self-denial, contempt for pleasure and gain, scorn of death or physical hurt, and the righteous vengeance upon an enemy were esteemed virtues, he was steeled against all fear and pain. His conscience was satisfied with itself.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>After his silent prayer, he rose to his feet very calmly and with a degree of solemnity. He had gathered fresh strength from his prayer. The ceremony of <foreign xml:lang="ja">hari-kari</foreign> he performed with grave dignity and punctiliousness.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>First of all, he gently lifted the two swords and held them in the sun, their knightly significance strong in this mind. One was to use against all enemies of his lord, the other held ever in readiness to turn upon himself in atonement for fault or fainted suspicion of dishonor, or, as in his case, when a duty has been fulfilled and honorable death is desired as a crowning end.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Shimadzu was without a lord, or, rather, he disdained and cursed the one under whom he should have served. Hence he broke into a dozen pieces one of the two swords, spurning the glittering pieces with his foot.</p>
            <p>Then silently he disrobed to the waist. Very slowly and precisely he pressed the sword into his body so that he might lose none of <pb n="189"/>the pain, which he would have scorned to resist. No moan escaped his lips. No muscle of his face quivered.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As the sword sank deeper his brain whirled with the dizziness of nausea, but, still stiff and relentless, his arm obeyed the will of his soul, even continuing mechanically to do so when his head had fallen backward into semi-unconsciousness. He was one hour and a half in dying. No words could describe the excruciating nature of such pains. Certainly, as a <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, his was a fitting end.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Such was the nature of this people that to his friends and relatives his act was regarded as an honorable and admirable thing. Had he faltered in its accomplishment they would have urged him to the deed, entreating him to save himself from the stigma of dishonor which would otherwise smirch his good name.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The following day a large number of Catzu <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> and vassals marched through the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> settlement and ascended the small hill upon which stood the house of the public executioner. The body of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> was carried with the utmost respect and reverence from the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> house, whence a train, bearing it in due state, departed for Catzu.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>From the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> house the Lady Wistaria, too, was carried. Her train was even more like a funeral procession than that of her father; for those who carried her <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimono</foreign> and who <pb n="190"/>followed in its wake had long been her personal attendants and servitors. Now, because of their love for her, they wept at almost every step of the journey.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The two mournful processions left the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Eta</foreign> settlement side by side, but their different destinations led to their parting company at the base of the hill. The one carrying the dead <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>turned in the direction of Catzu. There, fitting ceremonies were to be given to the departed soul of Shimadzu, after which he would be interred in the mortuary hall of his ancestors.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The train of the Lady Wistaria turned to the south, traveling many miles over bare and uninhabited regions, over plains, past hamlets and small towns and villages, on towards the mountains of the south.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>While the last rays of the setting sun were still illumining the west, the cortège of
                  the new Princess of Mori entered a forest of evergreen pines. When it emerged, the
                  darkening sky had deepened its colors until a melancholy calm wrapped the land in
                  an effulgent glow. The moon had risen on high and was shimmering out its holy
                  light. The earth, reflecting its gleam, seemed a tableau of silent silver.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>They had reached a beautiful and tranquil hill. At the top, above the pines and cedars inclosing it in nature’s own sacred wall, the amber peaks of a celestial temple, with its myriad slanting lights, pointed upward in the sky. Their journey was ended.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Very still now stood the cortège. Low and deeply bent stood the silent attendants, as
                  with streaming eyes they gazed longingly upon the slight young figure which the
                     <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign> Genji, almost bowed over with personal
                  grief, assisted to alight from the <foreign xml:lang="ja">norimon</foreign>. In
                  her white robes the Lady Wistaria seemed a spirit as she stood there under the
                  moonbeams. Mutely she looked about her. As the muffled sobs of her servitors
                  reached her ears, she wrung her hands with an unconscious gesture of anguish
                  greater than their own.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>As if in sympathy with the intense sadness over all who were there, nature herself seemed to show signs of her own distress. Clouds rolled over the skies above the mountains, veiling the moon and the star beams. A little river that flowed at the foot of the hill was heard sobbing as it rolled with a mournful sound over its rapids.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>But the lights twinkled out warmly from the temple beyond, and a white-robed
                  priestess was descending to welcome the novitiate. An odor of sweet incense, such
                  as of <foreign xml:lang="ja">umegaku</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="ja"

                  Wistaria turned her face towards it. Then back again she directed her glance to
                  her kneeling servitors. Her voice was as soft and gentle as a benediction.</p><pb n="192"/>

            <p>She hesitated on the threshold of the temple. Then silently she entered the place of tranquil rest amid the shadows of the mountains.</p>

            <head>XXII</head>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince Keiki had been on the highway three days before he became again something more than an unconscious automaton. After the first great shock of Wistaria’s revelation had passed from him, there had come a desperate terror and horror which seemed to numb his faculties. For several days he was not conscious of anything within or without him. There was no anguish in his heart or intelligence in his brain. His memory of events succeeding Wistaria’s unmasking, as he believed it, was as vague as the tangled threads of a dream. He had fallen into that apathetic lethargy with which he had been afflicted upon his arrest.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He had, it is true, uncertain recollections of a place passed on the way, or of a halt here and refreshment there, but he could not assert that they were real. He might have dreamed them. He could not tell.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then Keiki returned to his normal being. He awoke as from a trouble sleep to a world of torment. Could he have slept, and sleeping, have imagined the events with which the name Wistaria was repulsively associated? No! It was, alas, all too true. He must bear it. As the first sharp anguish of his awakening passed away, there came visions to comfort Keiki.</p>
            <p>When what he termed in after years his great awakening burst upon him, he found himself walking down a muddy road which led, his sense of locality told him, south to his province of Choshui. It was raining, fiercely, sullenly. Almost with a feeling of relief, Keiki found that he was wet. It gave him new life and new courage to do some simple elemental thing, such as drawing his cape tighter, closer about him. Then, as he battled against the wind and the driving rain, a fierce joy came to him. He was wise in the wisdom of suffering. His life should be devoted to the cause. No woman should destroy the significance life held for him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Too long had he tarried with inclination. He had pictured to himself a beautiful highway through life, upon which Wistaria should tread by his side. She was lost forever. The rough path, the developing path of struggle, should be his. He would not falter. He would be true first to himself, his higher self, and then to the holy cause of his country. Patriotism and the restoration of rightful rule to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign> should guide him in every act. The events through which he had passed had consecrated him anew. His life could not be taken; he could not fail, until all had been accomplished.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In the new life which he was about to enter his course would not always be plain; he would not always be understood. For that he must be prepared.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When the Prince Keiki had thus settled the past and ordered the future, he began to take cognizance of outward conditions, as became him now. It was wet, and growing dark. He must seek shelter for the night. Turning aside from the highway, Keiki asked the simple hospitality of the country-side from a little house hard by the path of travel. Although it was long past the hour of their evening meal, the good dwellers in the cottage, sent their daughter to the rear of the house to prepare food for the hungry Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Sitting alone in a corner, Keiki, waited upon by the little maiden, found a quiet and comfort that three days ago he would have thought impossible. A strange comfort exhales from a perfectly appointed meal after the heart has been tried. It is the acme of despair, the realization of one’s duty to one’s self. Keiki, absorbed in these fantastic reflections, suddenly became conscious of the fact that for several minutes past the little maid had been making strange signals to him. Seeing this, he signed to her to advance. She did so, but in a faltering and almost fearful fashion. When near enough to him to speak without being overheard, she glanced in terror at his face and slipped to the ground, where she prostrated herself at his feet, her head nodding in frantic motions of servility.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Why, what is this?</q> ejaculated the Prince, displeased.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Y—your highness!</q> she gasped.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak</q>, said Keiki, sternly. <q>You appear desirous of serving me. What is it?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>She rose tremblingly.</p>
            <p><q>You must not tarry here long</q>, she whispered. <q>The spies of the Shogun are about</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ha!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is broadly reported that the Shining Prince Keiki has escaped his fate. The roads are beset. They are tracking his footsteps. Even now some of them are before the house. Oh, my lord, I know you to resemble too closely the Shining Prince for you to linger here. We—the whole country—are in sympathy with thee and would befriend thee, but the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign>—</q> She broke off, her fear and distress completely overpowering her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki laid an alert hand upon his sword.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>None may take me now</q>, he said, defiantly, <q>for I am become invincible</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Come!</q> urged the little maid.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Whither?</q> inquired the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Pushing aside the doors at the rear, she led Keiki into the garden. Passing through it, they came to a wall. The maid spoke.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Climb this, turn to the west. Go along the road a bit until you come to a cross-path. Take that, and you will come out upon your southern route below the danger point. I—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>There was a movement in the bushes, behind.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, all the gods!</q> she cried. <q>It is too late, I fear!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What do you there?</q> a voice stern with threatening, demanded from the bushes. The maid responded:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Peace to thee! I do but bid farewell to my lover</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A laugh answered.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Do not fear, maiden. We do not disturb cooing birds</q>, came from the bushes, and a drawn sword was shifted from hand to hand, carelessly. The warm blood surged about the temples of Keiki. Because of the perfidy of Wistaria, he would accept no service from her sex.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I did not need thy lie, maiden</q>, he said.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then to those in the bushes he shouted:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am he whom you seek, the Prince Keiki. Come, take me!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>As he spoke, he hurled his cape to the ground and rested his sword with its point upon his sandaled foot. Quick as was his action, it was met by those lurking in hiding. Three forms glided out from the bushes. Three blades flashed towards him. Keiki’s quick eye perceived that those attack him wore but one sword. They were evidently merely <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> spies or common soldiery. Their clumsy handling of their swords filled his soul with a wild elation. He would have some play with these vassals—he, Keiki, the most exquisite swordsman in Japan, and the most finished <foreign xml:lang="ja">Jiujutsu</foreign> student.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Come hither—hither!</q> he taunted. <q>Without dishonor ye may yield yourselves to me, Keiki, the invincible!</q></p>
            <p>A savage yell replied. In imagination, perhaps, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> spies saw the glittering price of the Prince’s head within their hands. They closed with him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The hand of Keiki instantly snatched the second sword from his belt. With a sword in each hand he met the advance. The sword in his right hand met and parried the initial blows and thrusts of his two adversaries; the sword in his left met the blade of the third, and though it could not attack, maintained an effective defense.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The attacking swordsmen were startled. Such a thing was beyond the traditions of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, and a feat well nigh impossible.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Of a sudden the blade of the first of Keiki’s adversaries dealt a vicious blow. Keiki met it with his left-hand sword, and before the blade could be recovered by the enemy the sword in his right hand had turned to the second adversary. This one, unprepared for Keiki’s sudden onslaught, fell back, with his sword-arm severed at the wrist. Again the first antagonist thrust; Keiki met him. He now had an antagonist on either side of him, at points nearly opposite. He answered the blow of the one with the first of his two swords, while the other recovered his blade. There could only be one issue to such unequal combat. The position of his adversaries would not permit Keiki to fight them with one sword alone. Alive to the necessities of his position, Keiki kept slowly turning as his opponents tried to take him from behind. Suddenly Keiki fell upon his left knee, as though overcome, while with his right-hand sword he kept up a vigorous attack. The sword in his left hand became feebler, weaker in its movements. Thinking Keiki affected by some of the numerous small wounds with which he was covered despite his defense, the soldier on Keiki’s left rushed in to dispatch him, leaving himself but poorly guarded. The sword opposed to him became swiftly active. It passed into the breast of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>, where Keiki, glad that its necessity was over, allowed it to remain.</p>
            <p>Quickly regaining his feet, the Prince devoted himself to his remaining enemy, who was a better swordsman than the others.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yield!</q> threatened Keiki, as he dealt a furious blow at the other’s head.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>His antagonist laughed. Immediately Keiki thrust in quick succession at the other’s breast, head and throat. His first blow was parried. The second at the head was a feint. As the soldier raised his sword to meet it, Keiki unopposed, thrust through his throat. He fell.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Breathing heavily from his exertion, Keiki looked about him for the maid, and the spy whose hand he had severed. He found the maiden bending over the lifeless body of his antagonist. From her hand a small dagger slipped to the ground. Satisfied as to her safety, Keiki quickly drew out his left sword from the breast of his opponent. Then without a word he climbed the wall and took the southern route again, disdaining to follow the directions of his late hostess.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In a rice field farther down the road he bound up his wounds with the torn lining of his <foreign xml:lang="ja">haori</foreign>. Through the larger part of the following day he slept.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Alarmed by the recent occurrences at the little house by the highway, Keiki, who believed that the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> had put a price upon his head, now traveled only at night. The days he spent in sleep, and in locating, without exposing himself too much, the scenes of foraging expeditions made at night through which he managed to secure the means of sustenance.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The vigorous and unnatural fight through which he had just passed had a further invigorating effect upon him. Before that he had been near to death in his thoughts—death for the cause. Now he resolved in fresh and vigorous determination to live—and to live gloriously for the greatest cause that had ever made a pulse to leap in Japan.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>At dusk on the fifth day after the fight, Keiki set forth upon the last stage of his journey. He was now near to the borders of the Choshui province. A few hours later he reckoned that he had crossed the boundary and was well within the limits of his father’s country, when there came to him the sound of swords clashing beyond a turn in the road. Keiki, now grown cautious, skirted the spot through a field, and then crept within sight of the place.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Five men were pitted against three, while on the road lay the bodies of two more. Keiki had made up his mind to aid the lesser party, when an exclamation in well-remembered tones came to him. It was from one of the lesser party, old Hashimoto, a trusted follower of his father.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In a moment Keiki was in the road. Before either party were aware of his presence, he had killed two of the larger number.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I aid thee!</q> he shouted, as with his father’s men he engaged the despised Shogun followers. Speedily another of their number fell. The four obtained the easy surrender of the others.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Hashimoto approached the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>We thank thee for thy aid—</q> he began. Then, recognizing Keiki, he started back a pace and fell upon his knees.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My noble prince! My master!</q> he cried, as he caught his robe and reverently pressed it to his lps.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Thy master?</q> repeated Keiki. <q>My father, what of him?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Taken, your highness</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Taken?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>After the rumors of your capture, your highness, we at once determined to raise the Imperial standard against the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, and your father—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But we were not ready. None of our plans had been carried out!</q> cried the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Hashimoto answered:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>True, your highness, but your father was promised the assistance of most of the southern clans. Consequently he seized a number of Buddhist monasteries and cast their huge bronze bells into cannon. His undertaking was revealed to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> before our allies could join us, and he was surprised and taken captive</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He serves a sentence?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He was sentenced, your highness. But the gods have anticipated—he is dead</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki threw off his cape, which Hashimoto respectfully lifted.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Attend me to the fortress</q>, he commanded.</p>
            <p>The followers bowed deeply. Suddenly Keiki raised his voice.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q><foreign xml:lang="ja">Daigi Meibunor</foreign>! The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> shall die!</q> he cried.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The followers answered with a cheer.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With head bowed in deep thought Keiki led the way towards the principal fortress and castle of the Mori.</p>
    
    
    
      
            </div>
            <div>                     
    
            <head>Chapter XXIII</head>
    
      
    
            <p>Upon his return to the fortress, Keiki, as the capable and devoted leader of the cause of Imperialism, was deferred to by his brothers. He at once assumed in his own right the command of the resources of the clan.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The household was put upon a footing even more military than before. Regular watch was kept at all points of the estate and at the boundaries of the province. Reports of all crossing the boundaries of the province in either direction were made to Keiki each morning.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>An army of laborers impressed into service from the Mori as well as the friendly southern provinces were put to work strengthening the defenses of the Mori fortress, now become the war headquarters of the Imperial party.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The castle itself, situated within the centre of the province, approach to which on all sides must be made through friendly provinces, with the exception of the Catzu, because of its natural defensive properties, became the nucleus for a host of outworks sheltering the activities of Keiki. Within the line of fortifications surrounding the immediate vicinity of the fortress were the factories and foundries now built by those who acknowledged Keiki as their leader. For while all this owed its inception to the Shining Prince, it could not be carried out with his resources alone. The neighboring clans, whose lords in the past had held equal and superior rank to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, sent of their best to the Prince of Mori. The clans of Satsuma, Ozumi, Hinga, Nagate, Suwo, the Liu Kin Islands, and others ordered their artisans and mariners to Keiki’s headquarters.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The old Prince of Satsuma, more learned in European civilization than Keiki (although Choshui was the home in Japan of Dutch sciences), was the Prince’s preceptor. Under his direction the cannon foundries, whose weapons of war were to oust the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, were built. A sort of light rifle designed by Satsuma was manufactured under his direction near Keiki’s fortress. The castle, which in time of war would afford protection to all these works and foundries, was reduced in the number of its living apartments. These were situated within the inmost recesses. All about the old portions of the house were built broad platforms. Upon their edges were set stone walls with openings for cannon. These, as fast as they came from the foundry, were set in tiers so arranged that they could command the approaches to the large circle, within which were set the factories and works of the Imperialists.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In the midst of these activities Keiki found relief from the flood of memories that otherwise might have overwhelmed him. He felt that now he was rising to true greatness. For him personally, selfishly, life held nothing. It was for his country he labored. So austere and unbending was his demeanor that for months after his return his brothers forbore to speak of the message that had come during his absence.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>But one evening as he sat in his chamber alone, within the centre of the fortress, his brother Komozawa came to him and held out in silence the letter which had disturbed them. Keiki read sufficient to ascertain its tenor. Then gently he laid it aside. There was no passion to his tones or manner as he said, coldly:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Brother, whatever truth or falsity may lie in this epistle is of the past, and concerns me alone. It cannot affect the future. Speak to me no more of the leaves of last autumn</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But—</q> began the brother, timidly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki sprang to his feet. There was a cloud upon his brown, dark and threatening. His sword showed half its bare length.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Not a word</q>, he said, <q>or, dearly as I love you, this blade shall give you explanation</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Komozawa bowed submissively and retired.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In the thoughts that the words of his brother had called into being Keiki was led to remember the imprisoned Toro, whose existence he had forgotten. Immediately he ordered the youth before him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>To his surprise he found that Toro, instead of appearing sullen or dejected, was quite cheerful and optimistic. He greeted the Prince with so much bonhomie and frankness that Keiki was puzzled at first to know how to treat him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Toro</q>, he said, <q>I have come to a decision regarding you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>That is good</q>, said Toro, at once, <q>for I really am becoming interested in my prospects</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>And what are your prospects?</q> said Keiki.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro fingered his sash buoyantly, and assumed the attitude of a gay spark.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, if it please you, my lord, I should wish to remain in Choshui, but at peace and liberty, pray understand</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki frowned impatiently, but Toro remained apparently unconcerned.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>In fact</q>, he added, ingenuously, <q>I would very much like to remain in Choshui as a guest—such as your excellency was in my own province. I do assure you, my lord, that I have not been treated with the equal hospitality and courtesy offered to your highness in Catzu</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is impossible for you to remain here</q>, said Keiki; <q>matters have changed</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Then let me recall a certain promise made to me by your excellency. For my services in your behalf with my lady cousin in Catzu, you in return—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>He stopped abruptly, held by the expression on the other’s face. For the first time he perceived that the Prince was in an unnatural state of mind.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Wistaria, my lord—what of her? You do not mean to tell me that you failed in your suit!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>With a sob in which no tears intermingled, Keiki raised his sword, only to drop it, groaning inwardly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Return to your father, Toro. Be warned by me that this is best</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But I wish to repeat that your highness promised—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Listen. If you remain here, your life will not be safe. Do not further protest. I will say this, that if your lordship does not care to follow my suggestion, I shall be forced to eject you or allow my officers to deal with you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro shrugged angry shoulders, a gesture to Keiki reminiscent of his mother. The action displeased him. Sharply he clapped his hands. To the officers answering his summons he said, briefly:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Be good enough to have my Lord of Catzu taken to Catzu under such escort as he may require</q>. To Toro he bowed perfunctorily: <q>Good-day, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The preparations and activities of the past few months had brought all within the domination of Keiki to active readiness for war. Keiki himself was now of greater value to his cause since old Satsuma had taught him all he knew—the result of years of European study and reading—of the making of the munitions of war. The lingering disease which threatened Satsuma need carry no fear to the Imperialists. Keiki, the disciple and heir in knowledge to Satsuma, could well cope with any man in the world in the utilization of the war resources at his hand.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Only a pretext, a happening that should afford the opening wedge for war, was wanting to the Imperialists. The public mind must be quieted by the outbreak of hostilities as the logical outcome of some event, not as a sudden, uncaused outburst.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>It was during these days of waiting that the old Lord Satsuma sought Keiki out in the interior of the fortress. There was an evident perturbation and embarrassment manifest in his bearing. Keiki, alarmed lest some accident should have endangered one of the projects of the labor of years, started upon sight of his hereditary friend.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My Lord Satsuma, is it ill with you?</q> he inquired with solicitude.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>He noted that the face of Satsuma showed as never before that its master would never live to see the Restoration. This thought saddend him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Satsuma, though in some pain, smiled gently.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Ill indeed it is with me</q>, he said.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki reached out and impulsively seized the hand of the old warrior, pressing it with sympathy that words could not have expressed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I may not be with you</q>, continued Satsuma, <q>on the day of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">bakufu</foreign>’s undoing</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, do not say so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is so, nevertheless</q>, said Satsuma. <q>I must go before—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord, it is but the common lot—the common happiness of life to give up, to cease to struggle. Your achievements have been many. This rifle by my hand, that cannon in the embrasure, all these will speak for you with terrible effect after you yourself are long silent</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Prince Keiki, it is not for myself I think thus sadly of life and death. I have a daughter. We are on the eve of war, the country is unsettled. I cannot leave her unprotected to share its uncertain fate</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>But surely</q>, said Keiki, with a mild surprise, <q>your daughter will be well cared for among her many honorable relations</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Alas, no, that is not possible. Her stepmother is ill disposed towards her, and all of her brothers are pressed into the Imperialist service</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>This is very sad</q>, said Keiki, <q>and if it were in my power to aid you I would beseech you to command me immediately</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is possible for your highness to aid me</q>, said Satsuma, slowly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>How? Let me know at once how I can do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>By permitting my insignificant daughter to have the personal protection of so chivalrous a prince as your excellency</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My personal protection!</q> exclaimed Keiki; <q>but I am engaged in the work of warfare</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>True, but my lady would not distract you from these tasks. Her presence in the fortress need scarcely be felt</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki sprang to his feet and began to pace the apartment in a perturbed manner. Under his thick brows old Satsuma regarded him keenly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, said Keiki, stopping suddenly in his walk, <q>your suggestion gives me much pain, because I am unable to grant your request. It is quite impossible. This is not the place for a woman</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Drawing himself up proudly, Satsuma replied, in a ruffled voice:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Very well, your excellency. You refuse me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>After a moment, as Keiki averted his face and did not reply, he continued:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am an old man, traveling over the last stage of the journey of life. I had a natural longing to have with me in these my last days my beloved child. Hence, feeling assured that you would not deny the wish of a dying father, I took the liberty of bringing her hither with me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You brought her here!</q> cried Keiki, in amazement.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>She is within</q>, said the old Prince, quietly, as he indicated the interior apartment.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With difficulty Keiki curbed his temper. Satsuma had not long to live. He would tell him his secret; he would bare to him the source of his buried grief. Thus his old friend would recognize the impossibility of his being brought into contact with any woman, and perceive how unfitted he was for the task of protecting her.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>So it happened that while without a storm raged, and rainy blasts struck sharply into the faces of the sentinels about the fortress, Keiki related his story to his aged friend. Once during the recital the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shoji</foreign> moved, then there appeared in it two tiny holes. Once there crept into the room, mingled with the tempest and the sentinels’ sharp cries without, a muffled sob.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have passed through the heart’s narrowest straits to the mind’s broadest realm</q>, said old Satsuma; <q>but permit me to still insist that while your highness’ story has touched me deeply, I cannot agree with you that it should be permitted to affect the fate of my daughter</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are right</q>, said Keiki, gently. <q>It must not do so</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You will allow her to remain here?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Satsuma bowed deeply and gratefully.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The camp</q>, said Keiki, thoughtfully, <q>is no place for a woman, but here in my fortress she will be safe</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your highness</q>, said Satsuma, with much emotion in his voice, <q>no words of mine can express the thanks of a grateful heart. Good-night, my brave boy; the gods comfort and bless you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>In the adjoining apartment a small figure, half crouching by the dividing doors, sprang to its feet. A girl ran to him with a little cry and threw her arms about his neck, pressing a little wet fact gratefully against the heavily limned one of the old Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is well</q>, said Satsuma, patting her head.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>How can I thank thee?</q> she breathed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>By endeavoring to feel as if thou wert indeed my own daughter instead of a distant relative. But come, thou art pale, and your garments are soiled and torn with travel</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The journey was long</q>, she sighed, glancing at the frayed ends of her <foreign xml:lang="ja">kimono</foreign>, <q>and do you know, my Lord Satsuma</q>, she added, <q>I could scarcely hire a runner to carry me, because of my unworldly attire, and so I was compelled to make much of the journey on foot</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Meanwhile Keiki sat alone, his hands clasped before his eyes. All the bitterness of a lifetime welled within his bosom. He was trusted above men; at young years the idol of a brave nation; fate was bearing him upon a wave of the highest destiny that could not fail to beat down the rotten dikes of oppression. Yet all this brought no peace, no happiness. He realized in a moment the futility of all his efforts to put the soul of the Lady Wistaria out of his heart. Only in fierce action and strain that should engross all his faculties could he even find a temporary casement. After that, the gods pity him! After that, he could not live. There should no longer be any delay. There should be war, and that speedily, perhaps on the morrow.</p>

            <head>Chapter XXIV</head>
    
      
    
            <p>However fiercely the Prince Keiki desired and sought for instant action, there were excellent reasons in the delayed march of some of the clans journeying to the Mori fortress for the temporary postponement of hostilities.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki at first was bitterly opposed to any further delay, but the reasonable arguments of the older <foreign xml:lang="ja">daimios</foreign> and the insistence of Satsuma, the practical leader of the movement, won him over. It was their logic, not their authority, which restrained him. He would be compelled to wait no longer than a few days more, certainly not more than a week.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>One morning shortly after Keiki’s interview with the Lord Satsuma concerning his reputed daughter, who so far had kept apart in strict retirement in her apartments in the castle, Keiki found in his morning reports a reference to the youth Toro. He was riding post-haste in the direction of the Choshui province with the evident intention of crossing its frontier. What was the will of his excellency respecting him?</p>
    
      
    
            <p>So this, then, was the way in which the rash youth repaid his consideration, mused Keiki. Or perhaps he came because of the Princess Hollyhock. If that were so, he would send him back to Catzu again, with a friendly warning against the perfidious sex.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>He approaches the frontier?</q> he asked the soldier who brought the reports.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Yes, your highness</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well then, let him ride unmolested towards our fortress. So long as he advances do not touch him, but at the first sign of his return seize him and bring him to me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The soldier bowed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It shall be as your highness commands</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>So it was that Toro, to his surprise, was allowed to proceed unharmed through the hostile country of the Mori. His journey was without incident until his arrival before the fortress. There a guard barred farther progress with his sword. Toro flung himself from his panting chrager.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Prince Mori?</q> he questioned.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Expects you and will give you audience shortly</q>, returned the guard.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The young heir of Catzu was conducted to a chamber within the outer circle of the fortress’s defensive works. While this chamber was not within the inmost area of the edifice devoted to the living apartments, yet it was sufficiently near for the occasional passage of some peaceable member of the household through the grimmer servants of war to occasion no comment. Moreover, it adjoined the apartments set aside for the Prince of Satsuma.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Thus when the daughter of Satsuma chanced to pass through the chamber, none showed surprise until the youthful Toro came. His astonishment, however, was such that instantly his mouth gaped wide. Before sound could add its audible testimony to his visible astonishment, the girl had clapped her hand upon his lips. A quick glance about the chamber told her that they were unobserved. She took Toro gently by the shoulder.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Come</q>, she said.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Half an hour later she old Lord Satsuma stood before Keiki in alarm.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My daughter is not to be found</q>, he cried.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Not to be found!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>No, my lord. I committed her to thy care. Thou didst promise to guard her</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki was troubled. His conscience smote him, for he had painfully put off making the acquaintance of Satsuma’s daughter and had left her to the care of his underlings.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, he said, <q>I will have search made at once. Your honorable daughter must be found</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Satsuma, in deep agitation and concern, left his pupil’s apartment to make further inquiry of the guard. He had advanced but a little way into one of the armed outer chambers of the fortress when a note was slipped into his hand. He tore it open and read it through in amazement. After a second reading a broad smile overspread his face. He sought no more for his daughter. Instead, he dispatched a hurried note to Keiki, briefly informing him that his insignificant and unworthy daughter had become ill with longing for her home, and had departed thence on her own account. As she was very efficiently attended, he had no fears for her safety.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Meanwhile Keiki was holding audience with Catzu Toro.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>This, then</q>, he said, severely, <q>is the gratitude of the Catzu for me. I have spared your life, twice forfeit to me by every law of lord and <foreign xml:lang="ja">samurai</foreign>. You have come by, it seems, and are determined to make fresh trouble for yourself</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki paused. Toro answered, quickly:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I have come back to you, your highness, to offer my allegiance and my service</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Your allegiance!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My poor aid, rather, to a cause of whose nobility I learned during my stay in your province. Sovereignty is not with the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, but the Emperor. Place the rightful ruler upon the throne, oust the usurper and tyrant, and the rights of the people will be listened to</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Who taught these counsels?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My own conscience, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki smiled.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Are you quite certain, Toro, you did not read your new principles in a lady’s eyes?</q> he asked dryly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro blushed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The Princess Hollyhock appears to have been a teacher of some weight</q>, said Keiki.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro cried, warmly:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord, you do me injustice. I love the Princess Hollyhock, it is true—I confess it. But what my honor dictates, what my conscience has seen, has naught to do with the Princess</q>. Ingenuously: <q>’Tis, my lord, I do protest, but a happy coincidence that her views are mine. Were it otherwise, though tears did blind my eyes, I should perceive the right way; though sorrow chocked my voice, I would still cry, <foreign xml:lang="ja">‘Daigi Meibunor</foreign>!’</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro dropped to his knees, his extravagance of expression seeming not to have affected his sincerity. Keiki put out a quick hand to raise him. In a voice of deep emotion he cried, impulsively:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Toro, my brother, I wronged you. Now I make amend and receive you into our service. My heart was bitter because of my own sorrow, but it still has generosity left for you, friend of my hopes. You are of the days of flowers. Now, after the flowers have withered, I still receive you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>The flowers have not withered</q>, said Toro, impulsively. <q>Do listen to me. Perchance—</q> He broke off in some confusion, as by some sudden remembrance.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak no more, I pray thee</q>, said Keiki, commandingly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Forgive me. I would speak of my gratitude to you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Toro, I will place you in command of a small company. At first I could not do more without antagonizing some of my people. They would say that your adherence was too recent</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro replied:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I do not seek that honor. I ask a humbler station</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You shall be upon my personal staff for the present</q>, was Keiki’s response. <q>Later, as occasion offers, I will honorably advance you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki now rose. Bowing to Toro, he signified that the interview was at an end. Still Toro hesitated.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You wish to have further talk with me?</q> inquired Keiki.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I crave pardon</q>, said Toro, somewhat embarrassed, <q>but—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>He went towards the doors into the adjoining apartment and signaled to some one within. A youth entered quietly. He was slight, yet of a grace that owed to its being equally to his exquisite proportions and to his entire command of his physical being and comportment. A youth’s fringe hid his forehead. His eyes, cast down, were veiled from Keiki. He did not wear the armor of Toro or Keiki, but carried under his arm a small encased sword, which he handled easily.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, said Toro, <q>I have, as you see, been able to make a recruit. He was to be my personal follower, but since I am to serve on your staff I have no need of him</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am not an exquisite. I do not need a little man to follow at my heels</q>, said Keiki, surveying with disapproval the dainty lines of the little warrior.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The unwelcome visitor flushed to his ears. Toro glanced at him with what seemed a suspicion of humor. The youth, seemingly infuriated, whipped out his sword.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>A sudden suspicion of treachery came to Keiki as he brought his hand to his own heavy blade and put it at guard. But the thought of the youth attacking him seemed to amuse him also, so that he took no trouble to defend himself.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Perhaps, too, it was because of his astonishment, and the heaviness of his blade, and not because of lack of skill, that the tiny blade of the youth slipped down Keiki’s guard, and, leaving the line of defense, sought, cut, and carried away a rosette from the cuirass of the Prince. Plucking it from his blade, the youth thrust the rosette into his breast, while on his knees he offered his sword to Keiki with its point directed towards his own breast.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki made a motion of surprise. The youth had answered, and worthily, his taunt. But his life hung upon the generosity of the Prince. Toro saw that here was a test of the soul of Keiki.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Shining Prince laughed loud and long.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Good! I receive thee at once into my service. Thy name?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Jiro, my lord</q>, half whispered the youth from his kneeling position.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Well, Jiro, just now you held my life in your hands. For the sake of a worthy cause I thank you for sparing me. A thrust in the loosened corsage below that rosette would have done for me</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Jiro rose to his feet, but remained with his head respectfully bowed before the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro clapped him on his slight shoulder.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>In the days soon to come, when your life is sought by the foes of the cause, my lord, Jiro and I will protect you</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>When Toro, flushed with his strange success, sought the Lady Hollyhock, he found her wholly unresponsive.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>In faith, my lord</q>, she said mockingly, <q>it was not right for you, a Catzu lord, to ride through the outposts of your hereditary enemy, simply for a glimpse of an unworthy and insignificant maiden</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay—</q> remonstrated Toro.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>To abandon your father’s house and hopes for a girl—that is not what the daughters of Nipon are taught</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My dearest lady—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>To follow one’s conscience were an honor, but to forget all blindly, to betray your cause, to betray your house to win a wife. Think you she would have you after such perfidy? She would not be worth possessing did she favor you then</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>One little, unfeeling hand Toro carried to his heart.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Dear lady</q>, he said, <q>I did not do it for thee</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Lady Hollyhock frowned, and withdrew her hand immediately.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You did not?</q> she exclaimed.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, dear lady. I did it because of my conscience, because I believe in the Emperor, and not the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign></q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Princess turned her back upon him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are angry, sweet lady?</q> interrogated the agitated Toro.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>No reply.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Lady, you were angry with me when you thought I did it for you, and now when you know I did not you are still angry</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>A princess must have her brave knight</q>, said the Lady Hollyhock, haughtily.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You know why I did it</q>, said Toro, ready to forswear everything at her demand.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Again he sought her hand, but still she denied him.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, not so fast, my lord. Let me whisper to you a report I have heard</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>A report—concerning me?</q> said Toro, in bewilderment.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Concerning a certain Catzu gentleman who recently awaited an audience with the Prince Mori. He was placed in a certain interior chamber, which happened to adjoin the apartments of the daughter of a certain prince of prominence. This Catzu gentleman, it is said, disappeared into this lady’s private apartments. Since which time the lady has been banished to Satsuma by her own father</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Lady</q>, said Toro, in a great state of mingled fear and bewilderment, <q>I pray thee repeat not such a story, even to the flowers</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With a scornful and angry little laugh, the Lady Hollyhock, who had inwardly hoped for a denial by her lover, stepped away.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am not likely</q>, she said, <q>to tell of my own supplanting</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>She drew the doors sharply between them.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Toro, alone, mused upon the imputation of her words.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>She is mine if I tell her a secret</q>, he said, <q>but that secret is not my own; I cannot tell it!</q> He added, with a naïve wisdom: <q>Nor can I trust her. A woman is like unto a volcano, which, even when inactive, is palpitating to spit forth its fire, and which, when it does vent its fury, bursts the bounds of its late enforced suppression</q>.</p>

            <head>Chapter XXV</head>
    
      
    
            <p>A small portion of the night had been spent by the Prince in that sleep, troubled by nervous starts and awakenings, which was now his only repose, when there was a sound of disorder in the great inclosure without the fortress. The challenging of sentinels, the rattle of arms, the gallop of a considerable body of horse, came to him plainly within the palace interior.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Hastily Keiki passed through the castle apartments to a parapet high above the area of the inclosure. Leaning against a cannon, he sought among the shadows for the cause of the disturbance. If he had any fears as to the state of his defenses, none appeared in his face, now grown impassive almost to the point of apathy.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Gradually, as his eyes became accustomed to the semi-darkness of the inclosure, he saw that his followers were receiving an accession of fresh troops, many of whom were mounted. Quarters for the rest of the night were being made ready for the new-comers. Plainly, it was the arrival of some of the long-expected clans.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With the knowledge that a report would be made presently, for such was his standing order by day or by night, Keiki returned to his apartments, seeking, after a few further preparations, the chamber in which he was accustomed to receive guests.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Soon a number of his people, among them Toro and the boy Jiro, ushered in his cousin, the cadet Lord of Nagato. Scarcely had he announced the number and strength of the clans he had gathered about him, when he burst out:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Strange new, your highness!</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak</q>, said Keiki, briefly.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>With these eyes have I seen it. Ill augurs it for our land and cause</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Speak</q>, said Keiki, impatiently.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord, I have just come from Yedo, whither I went alone in disguise, joining my men only yester morn</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord</q>, said the impatient Keiki, <q>pray remember that the hour is late. All things wait upon your utterance. Tell me in a breath what is your news. What did you see in Yedo?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Foreign ships of war sailing up the harbor</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>What was their purpose?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>They demand the opening of our ports, closed for two hundred years, to the trade of the world</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Keiki reflected.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>It is evil—this complication with foreign peoples at this time</q>, he said. <q>But proceed, my lord</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The other continued:</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Four foreign ships of war are now in Yedo Bay. They are American. They are in much doubt as to who is the ruler of the country. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> Iyesada has assured them that he reigns supreme. Treaties are now being negotiated. The <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> has taken it upon himself to change the policy of our country without reference to the Son of Heaven</q> (the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign>).</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>This is treason</q>, cried Keiki. <q>We must march against the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> at once</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, my lord, permit an insignificant vassal to suggest that our country must present at this critical juncture an undivided front against the foreigner. It may be that the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> in his weakness before the foreigner but temporizes in his presence. The foreigner must be expelled, and, after that, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign> dealt with</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You are right, my lord. I congratulate you upon your wisdom and foresigh, and beg that you will now retire to rest</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>May I inquire whether you purpose taking any action, your highness?</q> inquired Nagato.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I am decided</q>, said Keiki. <q>In the morning I shall set out for Yedo, whatever the peril. I must make observations</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Long after the others had retired, Keiki tried to review clearly the train of events that had led up to this occurrence. He must decide upon his course. In spite of the European knowledge transferred to him by the Lord of Satsuma, the very term <q>foreigner</q> sent a vague thrill of unknown terror to his soul. He had been told of their arms and other methods of warfare; many of their secrets were his. He had, if not their armaments, at least fair imitations—gunpowder, cannon and rifles. Yet, in spite of all this, an emotion that was not fear, not cowardice, made its way subtly to his heart. These foreigners stood for a strange civilization which, despite his vaguely derived knowledge, might yet include greater destructive agencies.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Then who could clearly see beyond their diplomacy? They might come simply, as they said, to demand open ports. But their own history showed that such things had been the forerunners of wars of aggression, wars for the acquisition of territory. No man might know what the extent of the latter demanded. They were a distinct peril to the whole of <foreign xml:lang="ja">Dai Nippon</foreign>. Yet what was to be done with regard to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign>? Iyesada was dealing with these foreigners, making treaties, without the sanction of his imperial master, the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign>. If, on the other hand, Keiki should move with all his forces against the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Shogun</foreign>, would not the foreigners, taking advantage of civil war, better their mysterious position and gain whatever object they might have in view?</p>
    
      
    
            <p>No, it seemed clear to Keiki that, unless something unforeseen intervened, every energy must be made by a united country to keep out the foreign powers. When this was definitely accomplished the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign>’s reign would be established with little delay before the foreigners could recover.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>This was the final and definite conclusion reached by Keiki. He saw a certain advantage in the arrival of the foreign ships-of-war, provided they came in good faith. They would serve to distract attention from the aroused and armed state in which the southern provinces now were, to which they had been brought under his direction.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>I will go to Yedo at sunrise</q>, he told himself.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>His temples were throbbing painfully, the result of long nights without sleep, of long days of thought and care. He sighed and drew his hand across his brow.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord is ill?</q></p>
            <p>He started at the voice. It had a vaguely familiar sound. The young boy, Jiro, had started towards him a pace, and then had retreated backward, as though overcome by his temerity.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>My lord is ill?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>An insignificant pain in the brow</q>, said the Prince.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The boy slipped behind the Prince softly and fell upon one knee.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Dear lord, will you not permit me to relieve the pain of your august brow?</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince stirred uneasily. Again the strange quality of the boy’s voice touched some hidden spring of memory. Taking his silence as consent, the boy laid a soft, cool hand on either side of Keiki’s temples, pressing them with his finger-tips. The action, the touch, recalled in an instant a memory that was better sleeping. It was thus the Lady Wistaria had been wont to woo away the pain that beset his brow when he had lain ill in her father’s house.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Suddenly the Prince clasped his hands over those on his brow. Gradually he was drawing Jiro to a position facing him, when, eluding the Prince’s grasp, Jiro sank to the floor and laid his head at Keiki’s feet.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Oh, my lord, I beseech you not to be angry with me for my forwardness. It was my solicitude for your pain—</q></p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>Nay, rise</q>, said the Prince, gently. <q>Pray do not confound me with apologies</q>.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>With his head still drooping, the boy retreated towards the door.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>The Prince smiled at the fear apparent in Jiro’s demeanor.</p>
    
      
    
            <p><q>You have done me no ill</q>, he said, kindly: <q>you have actualy soothed away the pain. I thank you</q>.</p>

            <p>Upon his arrival in Yedo, Keiki made use of every precaution his ingenuity could devise, that the Imperialist might not discover his presence in the capital of the Shogun’s government. His approach to the city had been attended only by Toro and Jiro, but during the last stage of the journey the three had separated, entering the city from opposite directions to meet in the isolated quarter near the water-front. Here the Imperialist party found it advantageous to maintain a small establishment whose squalid exterior gave no promise of the comparative comfort to be enjoyed beyond the threshold by those in possession of the pass-word.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>From this house the movements and plans, the thoughts even, of the <foreign xml:lang="ja">shogunate</foreign> government in its own Yedo capital were observed and reported to those seeking the return of rightful sovereignty to the <foreign xml:lang="ja">Mikado</foreign> in his Kioto capital. Here at all hours of the night men came in mean dress, whose bearing, though consciously abased to that of merchants or labourers, was unmistakably that of the noble; here came strange, imperious young men who might pose as water-carriers, but whose hands sought an imaginary swordbelt at the least obstacle, and slight youths whose loose garments too poorly hid the curves of feminine figures. Of late the activity and the going to and fro of these persons had increased, but apparently without exciting the attention of the municipal authorities.</p>
    
      
    
            <p>Although the young Prince of Mori had employed all artifice in gaining the Yedo headquarters of his party, yet he was surprised to note that his person attracted scarcely any attention. His position of peril, and his naturally observant mind, on guard to catch the slightest suspicious augury, would have led him to exaggerate any apparently hostile glance. Everywhere, the sole topic was of the foreigners, their strange behaviour, their stated purposes, their mysterious ways, and their utter indifference to all Japanese usage.</p>
