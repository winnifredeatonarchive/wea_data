         <head>How I Came to Write <q>Cattle</q></head>
         <opener><byline>By <name ref="pers:WE1">Winnifred Eaton Reeve</name> (<name ref="pers:WE1">Onota Watanna</name>)</byline></opener>
         <div>
            <p>Although my novel <q>Sunny-san</q> was the first work by me published after I had
               come to live in Alberta, I conceived and I wrote <q>Cattle</q> as a scenario nearly
               two years before <q>Sunny</q> appeared.</p>
            <p>My main character <q>Bull</q> Langdon was back in my mind for a long time before I
               put him on paper. He was there before I had any definite plot, a great brute-man,
               dominated by his passion for cattle—the human prototype of his own prize bulls. </p>
            <p>At this time we were living on our cattle ranch in the foothills of the Rocky
               Mountains. We have a wonderful place there, and we were running several hundred head
               of cattle. I rode daily. Sometimes riding alone for hours over the hills or into the
               utterly silent woods, and I would come out into the grazing lands, there were the
               cattle and the horses; and sometimes I rode with our mon and brought in
                  <q>bunches</q> of cattle, and I would help at the round-ups. </p>
            <p>Then I heard the story of a young English girl, and of the fate that <choice>
               <sic>befel</sic>
               <corr>befell</corr>
               </choice> her at the
               hands of a brutal rancher. This story automatically connected itself with my
                  <q>Bull</q>, though the Bull’s character was drawn from no one man I know. He was
               a composite of several types I had met in both the States and Canada. </p>
            <p>One day I made a rough outline of the plot I had in mind. Then I rewrote it, in
               detail this time. When I was through I perceived that I had a full synopsis for what
               I then thought would make a play. Nevertheless I was not sure of my story, and I
               argued with myself:</p>
            <p><q>This will never do. No publisher will dare to touch it</q> and so forth. And,
               defending: <q>There’s nothing bad in my story. Truth is never bad.<note type="editorial" resp="pers:SC1">No period in original.</note> Certain elemental
                  facts of life are proper subjects for the story writer as well as the
                  psychologists. Some of the greatest books would never have been written had their
                  authors not possessed courage and confidence</q>.</p>
            <p><q>Cattle</q> was then still in synopsis form, but very detailed. I decided to submit it anonymously to two film companies. The Famous Players and the D. W. Griffith Company. I aimed high from the first.</p>
               
               <p>Meanwhile Mr. Murry Gibbon and Arthur Stringer visited me at out ranch at Morley, and I told them something of my story. Arthur Stringer advised me not to try to <q>come back</q> with a Canadian story. He said: <q>Don’t leave your Japanese tales too suddenly. When you are reestablished, then try a Canadian novel</q>.</p>
