            </h2>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">Only a short time ago she had been the very light of
               
               the tea-garden.  No one could dance with the wild
               
               extravagance, yet graceful delicacy, of Amoy, and no voice
               
               was sweeter than hers; furthermore, she was wonderfully
               
               pretty, with her little pursed mouth, bright eyes and rich
               
               abundance of shiny hair; and besides being pretty and
               
               clever, Amoy was gentle, modest and good, so you will see it
               
               was no wonder that she was the favorite of all the patrons
               
               of the house. Even the girls, who were usually so jealous
               
               when one was more popular than another, could not help
               
               liking Amoy.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               For two years, though a Chinese girl, she had lived the
               
               public life of the geisha-girl in Japan, laughing, dancing,
               
               singing for the entertainment of the guests; but this
               
               existence had not spoilt her in the slightest. At the end of
               
               the two years the girl still retained her native modesty and
               
               grace.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               But now all was different; for some months—ever since
               
               the air had become thick with dark rumors of war—Amoy had
               
               been very unhappy. One day the manager had come into the tea-
               
               garden, and to the great surprise of all the girls, had
               
               spoken harshly to Amoy, whom he had always treated with
               
               great consideration. This was the day that the declaration
               
               of war against China had been published on blood-red paper.
               
               From that day her life had become even more unhappy. Her
               
               employer had lost all his former cordiality of manner toward
               
               her, and the inmates of the house, the girls, even the very
               
               servants, had begun to despise her; for was she not of a
               
               nation at war with them, and whom it behooved them to hate?
            </div>
            
            
            
            
            <div data-el="p" data-rend="center">*    *    *</div>
            
            
            
            
            <div data-el="p">But even this was not all. To the sorrow that had
               
               resulted from her fall from favor was added the fear of
               
               losing her position. Business was bad, for the young men
               
               were all enlisting and the older ones were too much occupied
               
               with the country's cause to find time for the distractions
               
               the tea-houses offered. Mizutany, the manager, was beginning
               
               to talk of discharging some of the girls, and well Amoy knew
               
               that she would be the first to go. Amoy was all alone in
               
               Japan. Away back in the province of Shantung, in China, she
               
               had a half dozen little brothers and sisters and an old
               
               father and mother. At a very early age she had gone out into
               
               the world and made her living with a troupe of Chinese
               
               jugglers and players who had come to Japan. Her unusual
               
               beauty had attracted the attention of Mizutany, who made her
               
               a tempting offer for her services, and she had entered his
               
               employ. Among the frequenters of his tea-house she had
               
               always appeared light and gay of heart, and no one ever
               
               guessed how homesick and sad the girl became at times.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               The tea-house and gardens adjoined, and, in fact, were
               
               connected with a public jinrikisha-stand which was just
               
               outside the gardens, and very handy for the guests as they
               
               went to and from the gardens. At the back of the jinrikisha-
               
               stand was a large open shed, which served as a shelter
               
               during storm. In this shed, up one flight of stairs, was a
               
               large lumber-room, a dull, gloomy place, used both by the
               
               jinrikisha-men and the tea-house people for the storing of
               
               old goods, worn-out jinrikishas, broken musical instruments,
               
               and other plunder. Few there were who would voluntarily take
               
               the trouble to climb the rickety stairs unless it was
               
               necessary to store away some useless thing; yet it was to
               
               this old store-room that Amoy would come when her duties
               
               were over. In it was an old-fashioned jinrikisha, its
               
               linings worn to shreds, its calash top broken and its
               
               beautifully lacquered sides all cracked and blistered. This
               
               offered the softest seat in the room, however, and it swayed
               
               gently to and fro. Amoy would often climb into the old
               
               jinrikisha's heart, and there she would brood bitterly over
               
               her unhappy lot.

            <div data-el="p">The landlord of both the tea-house, managed by
               
               Mizutany, and the jinrikisha-stand, was Inouye Izuma, a
               
               young man said to be of considerable wealth. He was very
               
               much esteemed for his general good-nature and kindness of
               
               heart. Few gave more freely to the war fund than he, and
               
               when the call for volunteers came from the government he was
               
               one of the first to offer himself. With scores of others,
               
               however, he was refused the chance of military service. But
               
               unlike many of those who were refused, Izuma neither took
               
               his life nor became gloomy or despondent. Perhaps the
               
               government would need him later on. For this he held himself
               
               in readiness, and turned himself with a cheerful heart to
               
               the task of helping those at home. Many a family that had
               
               given up sons for service in the war, and were suffering
               
               poverty besides sorrow, found a son in Izuma, and found
               
               great cheer in his encouraging smile and helping hand.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               When the news of the sinking of the Kowshing arrived,
               
               and drove the city made with delight, Amoy crept up to the
               
               old store-room to weep alone. The day without was beautiful,
               
               and even the dark store-room was brightened by a few stray
               
               gleams of sunshine that literally forced their way into the
               
               place as though in protest that any spot should be in
               
               darkness. Amoy was tired and in trouble. From words she had
               
               overheard she knew she was on the point of being discharged,
               
               and she was distracted. She prayed to all the gods to help
               
               her. She even murmured a pitiful prayer to the Japanese
               
               goddess of mercy, Kwannon, to soften the hearts of her
               
               people—for Amoy had lived so long in Japan that she was
               
               almost a Japanese in heart and spirit, even though not for
               
               one moment did she ever forget her own country and people.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               All this time the old jinrikisha had rocked soothingly
               
               back and forth, and even while she prayed, Amoy fell asleep.
               
               The sunlight gleamed across her little head and seemed to
               
               spread a halo around it. Among the useless relics and worn-
               
               out vehicles and instruments she seemed more pretty than
               
               ever she had before.
            </div>

            <div data-el="p">She had not been asleep fifteen minutes before the door
               
               of the store-room was pushed open and Inouye Izuma and a
               
               stranger came into the place.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “I will show you the vehicle and you can see what
               
               repairs are needed,” Izuma was saying. They moved over to a
               
               jinrikisha that had met with an accident the previous day.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “This is the—” continued Izuma, and then suddenly
               
               broke off and stared with wide, fascinated eyes at the
               
               sleeping girl. “Look!” he said to the other man. Then they
               
               stood very still and gazed at the pretty picture.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Izuma had certainly seen her before in the gardens, but
               
               doubtless had never noticed her peculiar beauty, for he
               
               seldom went to the gardens save on business with Mizutany,
               
               and would merely encounter the girls in gay groups. Now he
               
               stood beside Amoy, breathing very hard, and his eyes gleamed
               
               and glowed the more they looked at her. Then very
               
               reluctantly he turned them from her, and transacted his
               
               business hastily with the other man, after which they passed
               
               out together.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               But soon Izuma came back to the store-room, and,
               
               crossing on tiptoe, stood for a long time by the sleeping
               
               girl, gazing at her with all his heart in his eyes. When she
               
               awoke he was still standing there, and she started up,
               
               blushing, and looking very ashamed and frightened. Izuma was
               
               blushing and confused, too, and they seemed like two pretty
               
               children.

               “Ah! I must ask your pardon,” she said, and even her
               
               little ears tingled.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">

               she had offended him; for in these days she was very careful
               
               not to offend when she could avoid it.

            <div data-el="p">“But is it comfortable to sleep here?” he asked,
               
               gently.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “No; not so comfortable as in the house,” she agreed;
               
               “but—but I did not mean to sleep. I wished only to be
               
               alone.”

               She sighed. “You a Japanese and ask that?”
               
               They were talking in pure Japanese, which language the
               
               girl spoke almost as fluently as her own; there was a

               blossoms into the tea-house and laid them at Amoy's feet.
               
               The girl understood, and grew quite pale.

               A number of the geisha-girls were looking curiously on,
               
               wondering who it was that had sent the flowers. Amoy buried
               
               her delightful little nose in the blossoms. She was pale and
               
               rosy in turns.

               the flowers?” She knew, but preferred to hear his name
               
               spoken.

               The man told her, a touch of surprise in his voice.
               
               Still Amoy hesitated. From somewhere in the street outside
               
               came the triumphant beat of the drum and the brazen call of
               
               the bugle. Amoy raised her little chin, and handed the
               
               flowers back to the man.

               hesitated, her voice faltering, “that I shall marry one of

               obediently, bowing very politely; and she stood still in the
               
               path, watching him until he had disappeared from sight.

               better of them, for proposals were not plentiful in these
               
               times. “Who is he?” they asked.

               envious, for Izuma was wealthy and wielded much influence;
               
               while Amoy—why, she was but a geisha-girl, and a Chinese
               
               one at that!

               said, proudly.

               if Inouye, his master, wished the girl for a bride, she
               
               should be treated with great respect.

               For three days there was no further sign from Izuma.
               
               Then his man returned. It was a poem this time; very
               
               beautiful, very flowery. Her eyes, her hair, her lips, her
               
               hands, her grace, modesty, and goodness—upon these it dwelt
               
               through all its many lines. The girl quivered.

               you marry him? We wish we had the chance. Are you betrothed
               
               to some one in China?”

               resolute. She knew it would be the last visit.

               back on the man. Only for a moment, however, then she
               
               flashed around; but the man was gone, and she felt faint.
               
               She ran like the wind after him, out of the gate and across
               
               the little rice-field, and she called to him, brokenly, as

               to Izuma's house. The young man had grown nervous and
               
               restless and could not wait there, so had come down to his
