            <div data-el="p">The Sun-goddess had spread wide her arms and had taken
               the whole land into her embrace. So dazzling and joyous was
               her smile that Yonejiro Nishimura found the courage at last
               to defy the august will of his honorable parents and to
               secretly wed the maiden Matsuba.

               A little, garrulous nakoda<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> had rushed pellmell to the
               Nishimura castle, and between his catchings for breath and
               his perpetual kow-towings and bobbings he had told the
               haughty lord and his haughtier lady of the mésalliance of
               their only son. An hour later Yonejiro with his girl bride
               was turned away at the gates of the castle.

               The young husband patted the little, tremulous hand
               that clung to his arm.

               “This love of ours,” said he, “will atone for the

            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes,” said the girl hopefully, “and, if we are
               deserving, perhaps

               man-child!”

               A shadow passed over the boy's face.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Psh! That is an honorably ancient ambition, Matsuba-
               san. I want no child to take thee from me,” he said.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “But,” protested Matsuba, “if the gods blessed me with
               a man-child—a son—why then the august parents would surely
               forgive us.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I desire not their forgiveness,” returned the boy
               proudly. “Listen, Matsuba-san. Last night the little yellow
               moon dropped down right to my window and crept in close to
               my heart. I could feel its warm, loving embrace against me.
               But gradually it began to drift from me further and further
               and further away, until it was nothing but a pale beam that
               I could only stretch out my hands toward and yearn to reach
               and hold, but could not. And I thought that thou wert the
               honorable moon, that had come to my heart to abide but a
               moment and then to leave me.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Beloved,” she said softly, “I, too, had a strange
               dream. I thought that this dread Spirit of Death crept upon
               me with stealing step. But I dreamed also that the divine
               Goddess of Mercy had pity on us both, and while thou
               stretched out thy hands to hold me, a flower, strong and
               beautiful and shapely, grew up between us and joined our
               hearts once more in a union that no death could sever.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Let us go to the old priest at the Temple Zuiganji,”
               said the boy fearfully; “perhaps he can tell us the meaning
               of our honorable dreams.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In the dazzling light and warmth of the sun-smile these
               two children, hand in hand, sought the temple.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Wear this honorable amulet, which contains a sacred
               seed, about thy neck,” said the priest; “the gods will bless
               you.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Promise me,” said the girl later, laying his hands to
               her heart, “that if the Spirit of Death shall touch me, then
               thou wilt take this frail body of mine, cremate it to ashes,
               and in my ashes thou wilt plant the seed within this sacred
               amulet which the good priest has blessed. When a flower
               shall come to life out of my ashes, then will I return to
               thee. Promise, Yonejiro-sama.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “I swear!” said the youth solemnly.

               “Such months of joy!” sighed the girl, leaning back
               against his arm. Suddenly she straightened up, and, putting
               her hands on his shoulders, she looked bravely into his
               eyes.

               “But this is the day,” she said, “when thou must go to

               their honorable forgiveness and that of all thy august
               ancestors.”

               On the threshold of his house a wailing servant flung
               herself at his feet, and, doubling over, beat her head

               They had dressed her in all vestal white, pure but

               Yonejiro, the heir to the title and estates, came back
               to his ancestral home an old man. With the immense sum of
               money obtained from the disposal of the estates he purchased
               all the land within three hundred acres surrounding the
               little cottage wherein the gentle spirit of his girl bride
               had lived and died. On this site and adjoining the cottage
               he built a noble shrine to her memory, surpassing in
               grandeur the tombs of his feudal ancestors. He then shaved
               clean his head, changed his garments to robes of flowing
               white, and became a priest of the most rigid and retired
               order.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His shrine was of a peculiar order and unlike that of
               any other known in Japan. One stately image alone sat upon a
               golden pedestal—Kwannon, the Goddess of Mercy, with the
               halo of the moon about her head, clothed only in the veil of
               her midnight hair, and with an expression of divine pity on
               her face as she bent over and blessed a little lacquer pot
               within which reposed the ashes of the bride of Yonejiro and
               the sacred seed blessed by the priest of the Zuiganji
               Temple.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Years ago Yonejiro discovered that the dust in the box
               had moved; the following day his sharpened eye noted a
               little mound in the centre. In seven days' time one small
               green speck peeped out of the mound. With the passing of the
               days the speck enlarged, deepened its hue of green, spread
               out into thin but tangible leaves, grew in stature and in
               shape. One day when Yonejiro came into the darkened temple
               to softly spray the plant with subtly-perfumed water drawn
               from a well of sweetest water, he found a strange and
               shapely blossom had spring into life out of the plant.

            <div data-el="p">
               Softly and reverently he knelt before it. And while he
               knelt a strange thing happened. The doors of the temple were
               frantically thrown open and one entered with a little cry of
               fear and rushed headlong across the temple toward him,
               caught his robe affrightedly and crouched trembling at his
               feet.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The priest laid his hand reassuringly on her head.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Thou art safe here in this sacred temple,” he said
               gently. “Pray speak thy trouble to me. I am a priest of the
               divine Goddess of Mercy. How can I serve thee?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With her face still hidden in the folds of his gown,
               the girl began to speak in a strangled whisper.

            <div data-el="p">
               “I am called Haru, the dancer. My master is Omi of the
               Sanzaeyemon Gardens in Yedo. At a fête to the moon I did
               please the fancy of the wicked Marquis Takahashi, to whom my
               master Omi has sold me for five hundred yen. I have fled
               from the city, and know not what paths I have followed or
               whither I have journeyed. They have followed my trail as the
               eagle its prey. Listen! Dost hear the sound of their
               shouting beyond thy lands? Oh, I pray thee, hide me and save
               me<a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> in thy sacred temple!”

               The priest hesitated. The girl crept nearer to him on
               her knees, until her head came close on a level

               lighted censer swung back and forth. The light from the
               censer broadened and spread and gathered into its halo with
               the flower the girl's upturned face.

               flower, as it were stamped indelibly upon her breast.
