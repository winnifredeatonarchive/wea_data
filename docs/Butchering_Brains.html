               <div data-el="p">The train from New York is due. Hollywood prepares to make one of its typical publicity
                  gestures. Not, it is true, of the magnitude or hysterical and blatant quality such
                  as is accorded a Star, a Movie Executive or a Peaches Browning<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>, but taken all in all, a nice refined little hullabaloo. After all, it is only an
                  Eminent Author who is arriving in Hollywood. He is met at the train by cameramen,
                  reporters, a star or two, maybe a director, perhaps even the Mayor and a bunch of
                  minor and major Movie folk that the publicity director has managed to round up for
                  the occasion.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	For a few days at least our Eminent Author basks in the sunshine and favor of the
                  City of Props. He is wined and dined, photographed, touted, exploited, interviewed,
                  quoted, misquoted. Every prospect pleases. He has a remarkable contract in his pocket.
                  Five hundred dollars a week for the first three months; seven hundred and fifty dollars
                  for the next six; one thousand dollars a week for the next year and so on ad nauseam.
                  Small wonder that he gives forth an interview to the effect that he is charmed with
                  Hollywood and intends to devote the rest of his literary life to the Great Art of
                  Motion Pictures.

                  effect that the option on his contract is not to be exercised by the Producer.

                  	To one author who remains in Hollywood, there are a score who make their silent exit
                  at the end of the three months. Not all go silently. Many fare forth shooting verbal

                  	“The survival of the fittest” does not apply in Hollywood, so far as authors are
                  concerned. The touchstone to success is not creative brains, talent, or inventive
                  genius. The inspirational writer, however big his dreams and his product, cannot hope
                  to compete with those possessed of sharp wits, craft, salesmanship, pull, politics,
                  and the thousand and one petty tricks that contribute to one's influence in this game.

                  packetty building. (Some studios are beginning to grant the authors offices as good
                  as the secretaries of the executives.) The refined hullabaloo aforementioned has become
                  a thing of the dazzling past. Our author has been patted on the back for the last
                  time.

                  been assigned to adapt and treat an “original” by one Susy Swipes or Davy Jones of
                  Hollywood. It is an amazing, an incredible document. Its language is almost beyond
                  credence. It is a nightmare patchwork that contains incidents and characters and gags
                  and plots of a hundred or more stories that are horribly reminiscent to the Eminent

                  that be hold forth.

                  mad.” Alas! How sadly these adages apply to the Eminent Author in Hollywood as he
                  forces his way into the sanctum sanctorum of a supervisor, or even such movie royalty
                  as the producer.

                  possessed of a sense of humor, keen, sympathetic, and kind. Others belong to that
                  clan that a departing author (was it not Will Irwin<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a>?) quaintly dubbed “the dese and dose and dem boys.” These bright young fellows sometimes
                  mistake Maeterlinck for a patent medicine and have been known to reject a story by
                  Victor Hugo because he “keeps a restaurant down town.” Usually they have a low opinion
                  of authors, consider them pests and bugs and duck out of their way when they see one
                  coming.
