            <div data-el="p">Despite his course at an American college, Count Oguri
               was a temperamental pariah. While he desired keenly to live
               upon terms of social intimacy with many persons, and while,
               not infrequently, he himself had made advances, there was
               that in his manner tending to the ultimate overthrow of all
               such ambitions. There was a diffidence in his mental
               attitude that led, not only to an embarrassed manner, but
               gave, as well, the appearance and qualities of a marplot.
               Oguri had lain awake long to plan, in detail, some interview
               or meeting that was to bring him the friendship of Cullen,
               the full-back, or Wright, “the star debater,” and, having
               settled the minutiae of proper familiarity with his
               associates, had gone down to breakfast, only to ask for the
               salt in a tone of voice that instantly attracted to himself
               the full gaze of the tableful.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He could not analyze the situation lucidly enough to
               determine just why they stared; they themselves could not
               have told, but he and they both realized that there was a
               strained something in his voice to confound him and to
               startle them. Then, for days, he would refrain from asking
               for anything, the experience of the one occasion vitiating
               the resolution of a fortnight.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When Count Oguri had again fought himself up to the
               proper pitch of pitiful daring, he would attempt the
               interviews. But, at the slightest evidence in the individual
               of that collective stare over the salt incident, his courage
               would evaporate into mere nervous giddiness. The incident
               would be reported duly by the sought-for one, and would take
               its place in the archives of accusation against the good-
               fellowship of Count Oguri.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Such was the temperamental impediment of Oguri, and,
               when it is added that he was a Japanese, the second element
               in the dissatisfaction that Oguri aroused is stated. Friends
               were kept away by his dispositional failing, as well as
               because of his nationality.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then, too, the understanding of Count Oguri, while
               easily outstripping that of his contemporaries in the taking
               to itself of the principles and facts of sciences and
               languages, could not admit unto itself any comprehension of
               characteristic student customs.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When a group of sophomores entered the rooms of the
               “Jap Slimer,” for the purpose of imparting to his “benighted
               Oriental understanding some slight compendium and
               illustrated appendix of the college custom of hazing,” Oguri
               could not recognize his urgent need of it.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “My pagan friend,” said a sophomore, “you must prove
               your ability as a 'Slimer,' by drinking this bottle of milk
               and singing that classical ditty, 'I'm a Pea-green
               Freshman.'”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The Japanese leaped to a pair of iron dumb-bells lying
               in a corner. “What you call this?” he shouted. “You call
               this civilization? I call it barbarism.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then, without further words, Count Oguri attacked his
               enemies, swinging the iron objects with long reach, and
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="144"/>
               
               with the earnest purpose of clearing the room, or of killing
               an enemy. He cleared the room.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After that, the sophomores let him alone, giving him up
               as one without a sense of humor. His classmates, however,
               discerning in this act a germ of class spirit, decided
               suddenly that they had misjudged the grim-featured Japanese.
               They called upon him in bodies. Again Oguri was afforded an
               opportunity of getting on with his fellows, but again did
               the shyness and diffidence of his disposition declare
               themselves his enemies. His classmates concluded that his
               act of bravado was animal instinct brought to bay, and not
               calculated class spirit. His own eagerly desirous
               personality had remained embarrassedly in the background. No
               one discerned that he wished to be a good-fellow before
               everything, but could not show it.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               College life has no toleration for the man who, as a
               freshman, cannot conform to its traditions, and to the
               unpopularity Oguri's temperament brought was added a measure
               of college displeasure. He was doubly cut off from his
               fellows' inner life; nevertheless, he did not think of
               leaving the college. He was bent upon becoming as American
               as possible, and this early failure did not deter him from
               going on with his course.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It was observed, during his next year, that Count
               Oguri, unlike many who had objected vigorously to hazing as
               freshmen, took no title to his privilege of hazing in turn
               those whom time had placed beneath his academic feet. In his
               last two years, when upper-classman rank gave him authority
               over under-classmen, he used the higher rank and its
               perquisites only to protect some unhappy freshman.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When Count Oguri, in accord with his Americanizing
               intention, left the collegiate hill where four highly
               fruitful, if unhappy, years had added their touch of
               development, and took his bachelor apartment on Fifth
               Avenue, he thought with joy that his outcast state was at an
               end. Here he could make a new beginning. He would put aside
               all his American past with his enemies and acquaintances—
               for there was none he called friend—he would even drop the
               almost repellent attitude, assumed during his last college
               term, and again approach the world in a spirit of
               fellowship. If no other way presented itself, his title and
               wealth would open a way into a society which, though perhaps
               bourgeois and sordid, must contain, almost against its will,
               the one man or woman who should be that thing he had dreamed
               of always, but never possessed: a friend.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With his general cleansing of old linen and putting off
               of old garments, he had decided to include his late
               associates. His entrance into the new world that streamed
               past his windows in carriages and automobiles, that surged
               by on the sidewalks, and that stretched out in fashionable
               brownstone as far as his roving eye could discern—his
               entrance into this world, which, perchance, contained for
               him its simple and single point of sympathy, should be due
               to none of those who had misunderstood him. A way would open
               itself, of that he was assured.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               A way did open itself, but in a fashion quite foreign
               to the imaginings of Count Oguri. One morning, his valet
               laid before him a sealed envelope, with his name inscribed
               in feminine strokes. Oguri held it in doubting fingers.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I feel,” he told himself, “that there is something
               within that packet which will have its influence upon my
               future.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Still he toyed with it, taking delight in painting its
               possibilities. Then, with a sudden movement, he tore it
               open. Count Oguri was invited to send his cheque in payment
               for the inclosed tickets admitting the bearer into the inner
               temples of a famous hotel. The occasion was a gathering of
               fashionables, whose ultimate idea was exclusiveness, though
               there was a side suggestion of charity. Decidedly, wealth
               and fashion had sought out Oguri.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="145"/>
               
               The Count sent his cheque. There followed closely upon
               this event a season when his temperamental difficulties were
               overlooked by those who paid him attention. If he nervously
               chattered in his idiomatic English, he was made to feel that
               they thought him charming, witty. If the silence of
               embarrassment came to the relief of his fluttering tongue,
               he was graced with a high-caste reserve of manner. Oguri,
               before whose eyes the newly-kindled fires of sycophancy
               shone too brilliantly for clear sight, was momentarily
               dazzled and deceived.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I am losing, at last, that pitiful uncertainty, that
               honorable palsy which afflicted me,” he thought. “Now I am
               myself; I am liked for myself.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He sighed with something he took to be satisfaction.
               “But have I found complete sympathy?” he inquired of
               himself.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He knew he had not. Yet these people seemed to like him
               for his personal qualities; they seemed to desire his
               company.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After a dance in a two-streeted, two-named
               establishment, Oguri and a young fellow, whom some recent
               ingenuous “street” operation had embittered, found
               themselves in the Hyphen café for a parting stimulant.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It's a miserable, hollow show, this seeming to enjoy
               yourself,” sighed Oguri's vis-à-vis.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The Japanese was puzzled. “What is?” he asked.
               “Oh, this social game. It's heartless and all for a
               profit.” The young man spoke bitterly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In his partially awakened joy of life, the Japanese
               felt that he could aid the other. He said:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No, my friend, it is not that. Take my case. Once, I
               was bitter against men; I wanted to be upon good terms, but
               they wouldn't understand me; now, I have lots of friends who
               want nothing.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Don't they, though?” The other was gulping down his
               carbonic and whiskey. “You wait!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Wait?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Just wait a week. I've been observing your case. I see
               signs of its coming due in less time than that—three days.”
               “I do not understand you. That, perhaps—” Oguri
               indicated the bottle at the other's hand.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The man became nettled.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Why, don't you know,” he exclaimed, “that there are
               men up there”—his finger was jerked vaguely toward the
               ceiling in the ballroom's direction—“who want to become
               well acquainted, only in order to rob you through some fake
               companies; want to swindle you out of your money? And don't
               you know that there are women—?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No, no, no!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Why, there are plenty of women there that for your
               title and money would marry—even you!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Am I so repulsive then that you say, 'even me'?”
               The other looked him squarely in the eye, with the
               brutality of the American who has passed through several
               castes within a short time.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well, you're hardly our most esteemed type of beauty,”
               he drawled.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The frankness of this man's bad manners destroyed for
               Count Oguri any value his note of warning might have had. He
               was only annoyed, not angry, and still less convinced of his
               friends' ulterior motives.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Yet, the time came when Oguri was again forced to
               consider himself an outcast. It was after several men had
               approached him for loans or investments, and a number of
               women had caused the idea to penetrate his consciousness
               that wealth is universally appreciated by women, and that a
               dark husband does not lessen the value of a title, be the
               land of that title as far away in distance and imagination
               as Japan from America.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then the old bitterness of disposition fell darkly
               about Oguri. For a time, his emotions were numbed through
               its operations. As the warmth of his own inner flame thawed
               him out, a light flashed across his purposes. He reasoned
               thus:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “All my life long I have sought
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="146"/>
               
               sympathy. I was ready to give it to others, but selfishly,
               merely that I might in turn obtain it. I have been selfish.
               I will devote myself to the study of my fellow-man. Then
               shall I find sympathy and happiness.” He paused. “Ah, there
               it is again,” he exclaimed. “I seek happiness selfishly,
               through unselfishness! No; I shall seek an interest in
               affairs that others may be happy, and, if by the way I
               myself find happiness, it shall be not my motive, but my
               incidental reward.”

            <div data-el="p">
               During the days of his social appearances, Oguri had
               come in contact with a number of persons who were unselfish,
               so far as the limitations of their natures permitted. They
               had asked him for contributions for this or that East Side
               work, or for a fund for the benefit of this or that
               dependent class. They had accepted his cheques with a real
               sense of gratitude, but still without any measure of
               understanding or sympathy for him. They were moral examples,
               but their very goodness made them too narrow to entertain
               other than the merest surface feeling for one of alien race.

            <div data-el="p">
               His new plan of life led Count Oguri to continue his
               subscriptions to their worthy activities. A young student of
               sociology, in need of funds to extend his course, managed to
               find him out. In this way Oguri became a benefactor. Yet he
               ever remained a pariah. The influences of his past life were
               too recent upon him and had made him too analytical to enjoy
               his occupation. Still, with his old-time persistence, he
               swung along his course, fairly kicking himself along the
               path of altruism. In time, this brought him a share of
               newspaper attention. “The Japanese philanthropist” was a
               picturesque object for the imaginations of reporters.

               One day, as a member of the visitor's committee, he was
               urged to visit the island where the waifs of a metropolis
               were housed. Oguri was not eager to go, but his firm
               conscience, molded out of the morbid materials thrown up by
               constant introspection, would not permit him to decline. He
               went.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When Count Oguri, with the large party of his
               associates, entered the foundling asylum, and saw on the
               lower floor rows of tiny tables but a few inches from the
               ground, with chairs about large enough for a doll, he felt a
               new interest. The diminutive, the natural expression of
               affection appealed to him, emotional outcast as he was, in a
               way to defy his most searching analysis. Yes, he was glad he
               had sometimes made a contribution that had helped a child.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               On the floor above, the entire party was admitted to a
               ward in which were the youngest foundlings, though none in
               the place was more than two years old. Nurses were few. On
               the floor a number of the larger infants were at feeble
               play. There were a few faded playthings, the common property
               of this poor childhood.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The entrance of the visiting party set the ward into
               instant commotion. From healthy, young, and weak throats, at
               once went up a wail. There was a pause of irresolution upon
               the part of the invaders. A little girl, standing still in
               the center of the room, dropped her faded rag doll, and
               stared about her with perfect self-possession. Then, while
               the visitors stood motionless, she walked directly, if
               unsteadily, to Count Oguri. At his knees, she paused; her
               hand reached up to him; her lips made a sound of kissing.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I lub you,” she said.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Oguri, dumb and amazed, stared at her. The nurse
               hurried forward.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “She's quite a noticing child,” the woman said; “she
               picked you out because you're so dark and foreign-looking.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh,” said Oguri, as he turned coldly away.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The visiting party's stay was brief, but, during its
               continuance, the little girl kept her eyes riveted on Oguri.
               Only the nurse's attention kept her away from the Japanese.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The party left the ward through the winding corridor,
               Oguri in the rear.
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="147"/>
               
               Just before a turn hid him from the child's view, Oguri
               looked back.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The little girl had followed him to the door, beyond
               whose limits the discipline of the place had taught her not
               to go.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               A childish foot struck the floor with childish
               insistence.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Tum back,” a childish voice called, passionately, as
               the little girl pointed insistently to her faded rag doll.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It was an appeal straight to the heart of Oguri. It
               reached him. With quick strides, he went back. The child was
               in his arms. Within him, all the bitterness of the past
               melted in the tears that streamed down his face.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I lub you,” whispered a little voice.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Here, at last, was the sympathy, the love he had
               sought. It had come to him; it was his forever.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With the child in his arms, the Japanese turned to the
               laughing group that had come back to see the issue.

            <div data-el="p">
               “What are you going to do with the child, Count?” asked
               a woman.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Adopt her. She is mine for this world and the next,”
               he said, solemnly.

            <div data-el="p">
               Three days later, the Japanese consul was called upon
               to arrange that Count Oguri might return to his native
               Nippon with his little heiress, and the matter was finally
               settled.

            <div data-el="p">
               “What, before all the gods, Count Oguri, are you to do
               with an American child over there?” asked the mystified
               consul at the railroad station.

            <div data-el="p">
               Oguri eased the little girl's position in his arms,
               before he answered. Then:
