            <div data-el="p">“On the day of my betrothal, I shall begin a little
               journal of my insignificant life.”This, I many a time told
               myself. “By that time,” I thought, “I shall have
               ceased to be a child, and must exchange the laugh of girlhood for
               the serious problems of the woman.”

               To-day I am fifteen years old, and to-day I was betrothed. Pray,
               why is it, then, my honorable diary, that save for the tears I have
               wept this day my heart is still the heart of a child?

               I can remember right back to my seventh birthday. I was then a
               tiny, small creature, with a flower ornament in my hair, and a red
               crêpe kimono tied about with a purple <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">obi</span>. My father took me by the hand, and
               together we crossed the fields until we came to the old-fashioned,
               but always beautiful, home of Count Kaneko. His little boy, Ido,
               who was but three years older than I, ran out to meet us, and
               pretended to chase me, so that I hid behind my father's <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">hakama,</span> and peeped at him with shy, glad
               eyes, for even at that early age I loved Kaneko Ido. All morning,
               we two played joyfully together, whilst our fathers smoked and
               talked.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               On our way home, I begged my father to bring me more often to the
               Kaneko home, and I remember well the words with which my father
               answered me.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes, little Dewdrop,” he said, “you shall play
               as much as you wish with Ido. Some day, I shall give you to him for
               a bride.”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               I danced with delight at the prospect.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               And the years of our childhood passed like a glad song, and each of
               my succeeding birthdays, and, indeed, all the days between, were
               spent with my playmate and little
               lover, Ido. But, one day, a dreadful thing happened. My dear old
               father died,
               and trouble thereafter took up its abode with us; for, scarcely
               three years
               later, my beautiful mother married again, and I became the
               honorable
               stepdaughter of Yoshimori Genjiro, who was proud and cold and
               stern. From that
               day to this, I was kept under surveillance, for my stepfather
               disapproved of
               freedom in the life of a young girl; he banished Ido from our
               house, declaring
               that as he was a boy he was no fit companion for me, and bade me
               cultivate such
               qualities as humility, meekness, obedience, grace and gentleness.
               Shortly afterward, Ido left the town to attend some big college in
               Kumamoto; but he wrote me a sweet love-letter before leaving,
               swearing that he would return someday, and claim me as his little
               bride, as our fathers had promised.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               And I waited days and weeks and months, and then years for him, but
               he came not back to me, though I prayed to all the gods that they
               would give me back again my little
               high-born lover.  Yesterday, my august stepfather said to
               me:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “The honorable Shinobu family have formally asked for thy
               unworthy hand to be given in marriage to their honorable son,
               Shinobu Taro. Tomorrow, you shall accompany me to their august
               palace, where the family
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="38"/>
               
               
               desire to hold a look-at meeting with you, subsequent to the
               betrothal.”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “But,” protested my mother, with some surprise, and
               despite her respect and fear of her lord, “the Shinobu family
               are of low caste, and Dewdrop's father was a descendant of one of
               the proudest families in Japan.”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Just because our family is of the nobility,” said my
               father, coldly, “that is the reason the Shinobu family wish
               to be allied with us. They own hundreds of rice-fields, and are the
               richest parvenus in the country. Our poverty is unbecoming to our
               rank. Our unworthy daughter shall restore us to our rightful
               splendor.”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After making this long speech, my stepfather glared at us icily,
               and then added, turning directly to me:
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You are a very fortunate girl.”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               I bowed, obediently, before him, murmuring my filial submissiveness
               to his will; but to myself I was saying over and over again:
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What shall I do? What shall I do?” For I was thinking
               of Ido. And, when my august stepfather gave me permission to
               return to my room, I crept from his presence like one whose spirit
               is broken,
               and I fell down before the little shrine in my room, and,
               stretching my hands
               imploringly upward to the pitying face of Kwannon, I begged that
               she would have
               mercy upon me.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               This morning, my old dear servant, Madame Summer, awoke me with her
               weeping. She had come to dress me for the odious meeting which I
               was to have that day with my future husband. The poor old woman
               wept bitterly, for she feared that, like my mother, I might marry
               some one who was taciturn and unkind.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Do not weep, dear my old friend,” I consoled her in my
               sweetest voice; “wherever I go, I shall have you always with
               me. Now, dress me, and be sure, dear Madame Summer, that you make
               me very beautiful, for this is my betrothal morn, and, besides, I
               am fifteen years old to-day.” And with that I fell to
               laughing; but my mirth ended in tears.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Shinobu Taro, my future lord, lives in a big, ugly palace,
               overcrowded with costly new furniture. His mother has cruel eyes. I
               shall be her slave, doubtless, when
               once I become her daughter-in-law. His father has a big, coarse,
               red face, and
               little, keen eyes that look at me in the same calculating fashion
               in which, I am
               sure, he regards the wares in his stores. Shinobu Taro himself is
               perfumed and
               greased all over, just as if he were some geisha girl or actor; and
               he has sly,
               proprietary eyes, like his father, and a cruel mouth, like his
               mother. He paid
               me extravagant compliments as to my beauty and virtue, but his
               compliments were
               as ungraceful as himself. We exchanged marriage presents, I giving
               him a sword
               of one of my ancestors, and he presenting me with a priceless
               kimono of the
               brightest red and yellow shades. Besides this, his family surfeited
               us with
               countless other gifts, so that we were forced to borrow five of
               their servants
               to carry them home with us.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After all the foolish compliments had been exchanged between us, we
               returned to our home, my stepfather in high spirits, my mother meek
               and timid as ever, and I in pale silence.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It is raining now, and summer rain always makes me melancholy and
               sad. Such sweet, soft, slow, oppressive rain! I opened a sliding
               door of my chamber, and looked out at it with a miserable face. My
               little garden, with the drops like tears upon the leaves and
               flowers, seemed to look up at me pityingly in the twilight, for,
               despite the  rain, mellow sunset had tinged the sky, and it was
               still quite light.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               I suddenly began to weep, in thought that I must so soon leave my
               dear home, and my tears were like the rain--quiet, subdued,
               unavailing.

            <div data-el="p">When I awoke to-day, the morning was
               tapping at my blinds, so that I opened them wide to receive the air
               and
               sunshine. The rain had all passed
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="39"/>
               away, and the flowers, in their bright dryness, had lost
               their look of sympathy.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah,” I sighed, “they are fickle as a
               child, whose tears are for the moment only. I will not look at
               them. They are
               hard and cold and soulless.” And, with that, I was about to
               close my shades
               petulantly, when a voice sprang out of the garden, and, from behind
               an old
               cherry tree, a young man's face smiled up at me like the rising
               sun.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Good morning, Dewdrop! Won't you come down and play with me?
               I shall teach you how to fly my
               old Chinese kite, and, if you are very good, I shall take you out
               in my small
               sailboat, and you will be the daughter of the dragon king, and I
               the fisher-boy
               Urashima, and we shall sail away until we find the shores of the
               island
               ‘where
               summer never dies.’”

               He came close under my window, and blew kisses at me, as he used to
               do when a little boy. My hair was all about me like a mantle of
               lacquer, or a cloud about the moon, and I knew my cheeks were
               flaming like the poppies in my garden.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah!” said Ido, softly, “you are more beautiful

               worship thee!”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Hush!” I whispered; “do not joke, dear Ido, now;
               but tell me, where did you come from?”
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, dear my little friend,” he cried, in a joyous
               voice, “I have dropped down at your feet from another
               planet.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “No, no, pray do not laugh at me,” I beseeched, so
               earnestly that he quickly changed his tone.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well, I have just returned from a long sojourn in the West.
               I have been in Germany, in France, in England, and even in America.
               And I have come back now to the Land of God and Home and Beauty,
               and--to you, Dewdrop!”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Me?” I whispered, wistfully; and then I heard my
               stepfather's voice, and all of a sudden I remembered everything,
               and my teeth began to chatter with fright and misery.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Go! go away quickly, dear Ido! Here comes my august

            <div data-el="p">
               But Ido stood his ground fearlessly and bravely. “And why,
               pray, may I not speak to my old playmate?” he asked.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Because--because--yesterday I was--because--oh, Ido, just
               because!” I answered him, for I could not bring the words to
               tell him of my betrothal.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               I closed the shutters sharply in his face. A few minutes later, I
               made a little peephole with my finger through them, and peered out,
               with bated breath. He was still waiting there, his head thrown

               the same little Dewdrop to you, always and ever. I pray that you

               To-night, I coaxed Madame Summer to go out with me for a little
               stroll in the moonlight. As we were stealing from the house, my
               stepfather, who was drinking, heard us. He called out, drowsily:

               laughing merrily at the smallest provocation, and making much fun
               and nonsense at all things.

            <div data-el="p">I dreamed all night long of the morning when I should hear that
               voice calling me. From the sheer force of my dreams, I awoke before
               daylight, and there I lay for what seemed an interminable length of
               time, waiting and listening. Not even the tiniest
               whisper of my name! Three times I arose, and crept to the window,
               and peered
               out, wistfully, and three times I returned to my couch, there to
               toss and turn
               and complain. “Why does he not come any more? He has not been
               near me since
               that night when he followed me, and I laughed and mocked and made
               light of all

               without. But,
               when I awoke, there was no sound. Again, I crept to the window. No
               boyish face
               was without to welcome me with eager, beseeching words of love. But
               something
               lay on my window ledge--something that made my heart stop beating,
               because of
               its rapture and pain commingled. It was a huge bunch of cherry
               blossoms,
               skilfully and carefully arranged. I knew their message. Ido had
               resorted to
               this, the old, sweet method of asking me to become his wife.

               the flowers, buried my face in them. Then, I drew them close into
               my arms. As I took them in, he came out
               from behind the cherry tree, his face ecstatic with hope and
               happiness.

               Downstairs, in the

               hereditary courage
               and filial obedience to his commands. But, as he spoke to me in his
               kindest
               voice, I kept saying to myself, over and over again:

               “You will be a

               “Perhaps, he is cursing me.” And, at this thought, I
               all but fainted as I kept bowing my assents to my stepfather.

               in a field only a short distance away?”

               as I reached the little gate; but, when it banged to behind me all
               my courage
               returned. I told myself that I was the daughter of a long line of
               brave men,
               notable for their fearlessness and courage. Should I, then, not be
               worthy of

               Ah, I could see him slowly climbing the hill, his flowers hanging

               His serious face lighted up. “Dewdrop,” he whispered,
