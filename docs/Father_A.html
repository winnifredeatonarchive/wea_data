               By Onoto Watanna <a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> 
               
            </h2>
            
            
            <div data-el="div" data-type="section" data-n="1">
               
               <div data-el="p">	So long ago that it seemed like a vague dream she remembered a fond little mother,
                  who had waited on her hand
                  and foot, and had obeyed her small imperious will. She remembered that they were on
                  a dream ship, which went
                  sailing on and on and on. There had seemed to be no ending to that long, tedious journey.
                  Small wonder—it
                  had taken them ten months to come from Japan to America in one of the old-fashioned,
                  slow-sailing vessels. Yuri
                  had once loved the sea. Always she was with the little mother, who would sit in front
                  of her on the deck and tell
                  her fairy tales of a great and wonderful prince, yes! a beautiful king, who had come
                  all the way from a great
                  country called "America," just for the sake of marrying poor little Madame Sunbeam,
                  and this great prince was
                  Yuri's very own father. They were going to America to seek him. Then the mother would
                  tell Yuri how his hair
                  shone like the bright gold in the Kwannon <a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> temple; his eyes were blue as the endless
                  glow of the sea, and he was tall, tall as a young pine tree. And so Yuri's heart became
                  surfeited with tales of
                  this wonderful father of hers, whom she had never seen, but whom they were going to.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Then one night a big, foreign, red-haired man, dressed in dark blue clothes, with
                  big gold buttons on his
                  coat, strolled across the deck and talked jestingly with the little mother. It was
                  a beautiful night. Yuri
                  remembered it distinctly, for the moon touched the waters to a silvery shimmering
                  splendor that gave it the glow
                  of magic.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"You sit up late, Madame Sunbeam," he said lightly. </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Yaes. I luf vaery much the—the night."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Is the mat soft on which you sit?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Yaes."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Let me get you a softer one. Ah! that's better. This your little girl?" He put his
                  hand on Yuri's head and
                  patted it, then he turned her little face up.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"She is very pretty. Does not look Japanese at all," he said with puzzled eyes.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri's mother smiled happily.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Ah! august Americazan, my child ees nod Japanese. Her fadder—a beautiful prince
                  mans from the West;"
                  she waved her hand across the water. 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The officer whistled under his breath.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"And where are you going?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"To my hosban'—an tell him <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">thad</span> he got one liddle childs—six years ole.

                  now to thad hosban'," she added after a moment very softly, "an' thad fadder."
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The tall man got up abruptly and took a few slow strides across the deck. Yuri crept
                  nearer to her
                  mother.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Does my fadder loog' lig' thad?" she murmured.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"No," the mother answered reproachfully, "jus' liddle bit lig' thad" (they always
                  spoke English to each
                  other), "he grade deal more beautifullest." 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The strange man came back to them.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"What was your husband's name?" he inquired.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Willum."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"William what?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	She shrugged her shoulders, smiling confidently.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Heavens! how do you expect to find him?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Madame Sunbeam smiled blissfully. She drew a dainty card from the bosom of her kimono.
                  The American took it.
                  It bore the name of one of Chicago's most prominent citizens—a millionaire, and—a
                  married man!
                  Perhaps the officer meant to be kind. I do not know. But he told Madam Sunbeam the
                  truth, adding in a strangely
                  muffled voice that it was best she should not be deceived any longer.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri remembered all this very distinctly, because her mother had cried out for a
                  moment, and then had left
                  her all alone, a pitiful, lonely, crying heap on the deck. Yuri crept down to the
                  little cabin, as children do,
                  toddling tumblingly down the stairs, one little foot following the other. The mother
                  was lying on the
                  floor—asleep. Yuri crept to her and kissed her, for she was smiling and looked very
                  beautiful. Then
                  something dark and red colored her little hand and she screamed aloud in terror, for
                  she was very frightened as
                  she knew not what. 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri cried all that long night through, for they carried her mother from her—two
                  big, tall men. Some of
                  the beautiful ladies on the ship had cried, and one of them had taken Yuri in her
                  arms and tried to soothe her.
                  She never saw her mother again. That was years and years ago. 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri was nineteen years old now. She wore American clothes—a cotton shirtwaist and
                  cloth skirt, but in
                  her bosom she, too, carried a little card, as her mother had done, and the girl knew
                  it bore her father's name.
                  
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Some kind American woman had given the little waif a home when they had arrived.
                  She was a poor woman,
                  however, and as soon as Yuri was old enough she secured her a position in one of the
                  large dry-goods stores of
                  Chicago, and here the girl had worked ever since. Her life had been uneventful since
                  then. She worked from eight
                  in the morning till six at night, and her beautiful little half-foreign face bore
                  the pallor of the shop-clerk.
                  The girl was a dreamer. If she had ambition it had been smothered from the stern necessity
                  of the moment. Her
                  kind benefactor had died, and she was left utterly alone in the world and altogether
                  dependent on herself.
                  Mechanically she took up the burden of life, going to and from work each day, ever
                  gentle and courteous to her
                  fellow-workers, never familiar with them, knowing none of them intimately. Instinctively
                  the girl felt she was
                  different from them, and she shrank in her supersensitiveness from mixing with companions
                  who were as foreign to
                  her as if they had lived in different parts of the world all their lives. 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri was beautiful, with a wild, inexplicable beauty that defied description. She
                  did not look Japanese. She
                  did not look American. Her face was mysterious in its dusky mixed beauty, but the
                  immeasurable wistfulness and
                  sadness of the half-breed were stamped indelibly on her features and reflected in
                  the somber depths of her dark
                  eyes.

                  That gentleman, still
                  quite a young man himself, was highly incensed and disgusted with his young son. He
                  himself was a rich banker,
                  and he had married a

                  wife with the blood of Condé <a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a>  in her veins. He was one of those self-made
                  Americans who reverence blood and aristocracy, and in return for the superabundance
                  of wealth they bestow on
                  their children, demand that they marry to please them. Mr. Latimer was thoroughly
                  disgusted with his son. Is this
                  all his Yale training had done for him? Where had he inherited his low taste from?
                  Latimer, Sr., refused to even
                  discuss the subject. A shop-girl! Gerald was to distinctly understand that he disapproved
                  of it, and would cut
                  him off without a penny and refuse to see him again if he persisted in his mad folly;
                  and after having delivered
                  himself of the foregoing to Gerald, Mr. Latimer betook him to the Union League Club
                  and tried to forget in a bird
                  and a bottle of Burgundy the irritating fact that his son had a will of his own also.

                  She was one of those
                  chronic invalids who pamper a perhaps imaginary malady, but she was kinder than the
                  father, and really had more
                  genuine love and affection for her son. She herself had been starved for want of affection.

               <div data-el="p">	It was a bright Sunday afternoon that Gerald brought Yuri to his home. Mrs. Latimer
                  was sitting up, with a
                  bright color in each cheek. She was waiting for Gerald, who had gone to get Yuri.
                  She wondered what her husband
                  would say if he knew the truth. This was the first time she had ever dared defy him
                  about anything. Downstairs in
                  the library he was reading the Sunday papers and smoking. He had been in a good-natured
                  mood lately. She knew he
                  would join them soon in her sitting-room, and would know the truth. She rose nervously
                  to her feet when she heard
                  Gerald's quick, joyous tread on the stairs. Now she was looking at Yuri, the half-Japanese
                  girl of whom Gerald
                  had raved—the shop-girl her husband detested, without knowing.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The girl was the most composed of the three, for she knew nothing as yet.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"I am glad to meet Mr. Gerald's mother," she said simply.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	She called him "Mr. Gerald" always, the mother noticed, and it sounded soft and pretty
                  from her lips. Neither
                  of the two women spoke much. Gerald monopolized most of the conversation, and told
                  them bright, witty college
                  tales, chasing away the constraint and fear from the mother's face, and lighting Yuri's
                  with arch fun.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Your house is so beautiful," she told Mrs. Latimer directly, looking about her.
                  She got up and stood with
                  clasped hands before a large oil painting in the room.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"That is mother when a girl."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Tha's vaery beautiful." There was still a foreign lisp left. "An' your father? You
                  have picture, too, of <span data-el="hi" data-rend="underline">heem</span>?"
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Well, not large like that. Mother where's that small medallion of father, taken
                  about the same time as
                  yours? Ah! here it is." He put the miniature on ivory into the girl's hand.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Yuri had grown quite white, and her eyes were dilated and fixed on the miniature
                  in her hand. She did not
                  speak, nor did she hear what Gerald was saying.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Wasn't he a handsome fellow though? He has scarcely changed now. Ah! here he comes,
                  I hear his step."
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The girl was not white now. A rich flush suffused her face, making it very beautiful,
                  and her sharp, dark
                  eyes had  a strange magnetism as they looked straight at Mr. Latimer and held him
                  in their power.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Gerald had risen to his feet with forced carelessness, for although he had confidence
                  that his father, who
                  was always so polished and gallant before strangers, would not betray his anger before
                  the girl, he was afraid to
                  actually displease him.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Father, with mamma's permission I brought Miss a—a Sentaro to meet you."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Whatever surprise or anger his father felt, he did not betray it, for the girl was
                  very beautiful. He bowed
                  courteously to her, murmuring something about "pleasure at meeting," and forgetting
                  even to give a side glance of
                  displeasure at his wife and son. The girl did not return the greeting in the slightest.
                  There was a peculiar look
                  about her face, and she was standing very straight and proudly. She turned to Gerald.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"I call you always 'Mr. Gerald.' Ees thad your name?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The young man flushed.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Yes, my first name; Professor Grenier always called me that and—" </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Oh! I din know thad. What ees—?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Our last name? Oh! Latimer."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The girl was quiet now, her eyes still on the older man's face.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	She suddenly slipped her hand into the bosom of her gown and pulled out an old card
                  and a faded
                  miniature.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Are those yours?" she asked Mr. Latimer. He took them wonderingly from her.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Mine? Why, no; that is—yes. By Jove! Where—"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The girl interrupted him. She had forgotten the mother and son.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"You are my father," she said slowly.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Your father!" they all echoed it—stupidly.</div>
               
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="div" data-type="section" data-n="4">

               <div data-el="p">	"Yaes!" Her eyes were stern with hatred and contempt now. "Yaes, my mother left me
                  only that to know my
                  father by. Do you remember her? Madame Sunbeam of Nagasaki?"
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The man had come closer to her now, and was looking at her face with sad eyes.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Yes, yes; and <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">you</span>." 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"I was born after you left—nineteen years ago."</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	He saw his wife's white, horror-stricken face, his son's stupefied look of agony,
                  and he tried to pull
                  himself together.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"I—er—" </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"My mother killed herself." The girl's voice was relentless as fate. "They told her
                  you had a wife here in
                  America. She did not care to live after that—"
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Father! Father! Yuri! What does it mean?"</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Gerald's frantic voice broke on them now. He had stood there listening, only half
                  comprehending the truth.
                  The cry seemed wrung from him. 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"Father, I love her. If—if it is all a hideous mistake, say something. Speak—for
                  God's sake!"
                  
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"It is true," he said, brokenly.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	Gerald rose unsteadily. He looked at his father a moment, and caressed the girl with
                  one last look of love
                  and heartbreak; then he turned and left them.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"He will recover," said the father, "he is only a boy. You shall have everything
                  money can buy, all heart
                  could desire; I will—" 
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	The tense excitement was gone. Weary shadows of care crept into the girl's face.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">	"But I—I love him with all my soul," she said brokenly.</div>
