               <div data-el="p">Miss Onoto Watanna is an Anglo-Japanese
                  lady born in Japan, but educated in this country. At an
                  early age she began her literary career as a writer for the
                  newspapers and magazines, but did not achieve any
                  considerable note until the publication of her novel, “A
                  Japanese Nightingale,” which brought her at a bound among
                  the most prominent women authors of to-day. While living in
                  America, she did not permit herself to get out of touch with
                  the calm and beautiful life of her native land; her
                  understanding of present-day conditions in Japan and her
                  keen appreciation of Japanese character, as shown in her
                  successful book and her later essays on Japanese women,
                  prove her a valuable authority on all matters of importance
                  as they are in the land of the Mikado. The following paper
                  on Japanese women can be accepted as the final word on the
                  woman of Japan as seen and understood by one of her own
                  race.

               <h3>The Happy Lot of Japanese Women.</h3>
               
               <div data-el="p">Well-meaning lecturers before missionary societies have
                  often drawn what seemed vivid and realistic pictures of the
                  undesirable position of the women of Japan as compared with
                  that of the women of the West; and such societies have sent
                  out yearly a great number of their members to the East,
                  where they seek not merely to lift them from the darkness of
                  their heathendom, but to arouse their minds to a realization
                  of the blessings of their Western sisters that are denied to
                  them. Thus are the seeds of discontent, misnamed by the
                  missionaries ambition, sown among the women of Japan.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  To a close student of the conditions of the sex, both
                  in this country and in the East, it becomes a question as to
                  whether or not all these intentions and attentions are
                  misdirected.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  The position of women in Japan, as a matter of fact, is
                  far from being deplorable, and in many respects is worthy of
                  praise and respect. I speak, of course, of the women of
                  Japan whose white lives are open to the sharpest X-rays of
                  the West. There is no question of the pitiable condition of
                  those young women who gild the open ports; but they are not
                  the representative women of Japan, and though, to the
                  foreigner in Japan, apparently more in evidence, represent
                  the minority.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  In the first place, it is a mistake to suppose that a
                  Japanese girl is not given opportunity for an education as
                  good as that offered to American girls. School attendance is
                  compulsory all over the country, and the school system of
                  Japan to-day will stand comparison with that of any country.
                  Apart from what she may learn in school and college, she has
                  another kind of an education—that gentle home up-bringing
                  which instills into her mind
                  
                  <hr data-el="pb" data-n="236"/>
                  from earliest childhood such qualities as modesty, meekness,
                  politeness, gentleness, and filial obedience and respect.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  The seclusion in which she lives is praiseworthy and
                  admirable in many respects, and even her marriage to a
                  comparative stranger to her is a far more joyful event in
                  her life than one would imagine. Just because of her maiden
                  life of seclusion, she is not brought into contact with the
                  opposite sex, and, as she is essentially romantic and poetic
                  by disposition, she looks forward to meeting and eventually
                  marrying the young man who has been chosen for her by her
                  honorable parents. He is the first of the opposite sex,
                  outside her immediate family, with whom she becomes
                  acquainted, and, unless he is repugnant to her, she allows
                  herself to fall in love with him. She is permitted to see
                  him several times before betrothal, and good parents do not
                  force their children into marriages that would prove
                  obnoxious to them.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  As a wife and mother, the Japanese woman's life is
                  neither narrow nor limited. True, whatever public spirit she
                  may have finds its outlet on the platform of her home, where
                  to her immediate family she imparts such words of advice,
                  caution, and wisdom as are often poured from the platforms
                  of women's clubs in America. Her home is her club and her
                  children and husband her audience. Her duty to her race is
                  accomplished through
                  
                  <hr data-el="pb" data-n="237"/>
                  her tender counsel and even education of these citizens.
                  Because a Japanese woman's voice is not heard aloud in the
                  public affairs of the nation, be sure this is not because
                  the country lacks women who have the spirit and the talent
                  to help their race along in that march of progression which
                  is the marvel of the world.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  In all the world there is no more devoted husband than
                  a Japanese, and to him his wife is his counsellor as well as
                  his most humble servant. In the latter capacity, it is her
                  delight to serve and minister to his wants, and to see that
                  his home life is so full of tranquility and repose that he
                  may gain from it that strength with which he must gird
                  himself to enter upon the battle of life in the great world
                  outside the home, and in whose doings she may not take a
                  part, save only in so far as to prepare her lord for the
                  fray.

                  But is not the foundation the rock on which the most
                  monumental structures must stand? And the women of Japan
                  constitute the foundation stone of their country.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Too much has been written of the naïveté, the
                  bewitching coquetry and doll-like prettiness of the women of
                  Japan. Too little has been written of those silent, small,
                  brave figures that stand in the background of the home life
                  of Japan, and whose gentle influence is shown and felt in
                  the nature and spirit of this race.

                  Nor, indeed, is a Japanese woman's life entirely
                  confined to her home. After marriage comes a pleasant social
                  intercourse with her neighbors and friends; and while
                  society, as it is known in the West, can hardly be said to
                  exist save among the wives of men in the diplomatic service
                  who are thrust into the glare of the arena which constitutes
                  Western society in Japan, she has her own circle of good
                  friends.
