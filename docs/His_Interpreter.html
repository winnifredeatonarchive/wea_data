               plans and sketches that were spread before him. His fine,
               
               fair face was drawn with his intense absorption in his task,
               
               and the heavy lines on his forehead showed he was puzzled
               
               over something regarding it. Often he would turn from his
               
               plans to a large book, and run his hand down a list of
               
               figures, frowning heavily as if<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> their volume annoyed him.
               
               After a time, he pushed the book and maps from him, and
               
               running his hand wearily through his hair, leaned back in
               
               his chair, with half-closed eyes and irresolute mouth and
               
               chin.

               A polite Japanese looked in at him from an adjoining
               
               office with the calm, half wondering, wholly unreadable
               
               countenance peculiar to the better class of Japanese.

               The American observed him at the door, and called to
               
               him:

            <div data-el="p">
               
               The American's crisp, nervous explanation to his
               
               interpreter was listened to with the gravest attention, the
               
               latter scarcely commenting until the American had ceased
               
               speaking. Then he leaned over the plans and studied them
               
               silently a moment.
            </div>

               “I don't see that I've made it particularly clear to
               
               you, Inouye,” the American put in, hastily, lighting a cigar
               
               and watching with half-closed eyes his assistant's apparent
               
               interest in the plans.

               “It's like this. I have the contract all right, and
               
               Takamine is willing to put up a good part of the money. You
               
               understand that thus far I have merely represented an
               
               American syndicate. Now I have the choice of taking up the
               
               work with the sole financial help of Takamine, pushing it
               
               along and doubtless making a pretty good profit for both of
               
               us; but owing to the slenderness of our financial resources,
               
               we could only afford to do the work in a limited way. Of
               
               course, it might make a pretty big thing for both Takamine
               
               and myself, but I cannot help wanting to push so splendid an
               
               opportunity to its fullest extent, and do the work on an
               
               immense scale. This is only possible with the financial aid,
               
               or, indeed, by my putting things entirely into the hands of
               
               the syndicate, and then perhaps profits would not accrue for
               
               some time. Of course, I understand there would be,” he
               
               repeated, “a big profit for both Takamine and myself if I
               
               simply pushed it along at once, without advising the
               
               syndicate; but the deuce is that I can scarcely do that
               
               without seriously impairing and perhaps altogether breaking
               
               my relations with the syndicate, and somehow—well, I can't
               
               afford to do that.”

               His handsome face clouded with perplexity and
               
               dissatisfaction. The Japanese raised his head from the
               
               plans, and asked, calmly:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Is there greater profit in the work, Mr. Arthurs,
               
               should the American syndicate take the contract?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               The American shifted in his seat, nervously turning
               
               over the sides of his blotter.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Well, a more general profit, Inouye. The syndicate has
               
               controlled all my work thus far. I am anxious to get other
               
               contracts on top of this one, and I would more likely be
               
               able to get them if I carried out this one with the
               
               assistance of the syndicate. Couldn't afford to do it alone.
               
               This, if properly carried out, means only the beginning of
               
               an immense lot of work—the cars, the miles of rail I have
               
               calculated building in the future, could only be
               
               accomplished with the aid of the syndicate. The question is
               
               whether I shall merely carry out this contract and make
               
               immediate profits for myself and Takamine, or let the
               
               syndicate put up the big cash, buy American material, and—
               
               well, make a fortune for the syndicate, too. You understand
               
               in America these syndicates are immensely wealthy. With the
               
               mere permit of the Japanese government the rest comes easily
               
               enough. If the contract passes into the hands of the
               
               syndicate it means a good position, and in time a good
               
               fortune, for myself; but in that event it passes out of
               
               Takamine's hands altogether, he being merely one of a good
               
               many stockholders.”

            <div data-el="p">The Japanese walked to the door and looked out across
               
               the blue fields. He was not thinking of the American's
               
               plans. His mind was absorbed in the image of a young maiden,
               
               the daughter of Takamine. At one time he had been almost as
               
               a son to Takamine, whose hospitable doors were constantly
               
               open to receive him. With the over-hasty conceit and
               
               impetuosity of a young man, his friend's kindness to him
               
               made him overbold, so that he had asked the father for the
               
               daughter in marriage. Takamine was a wealthy man, though
               
               perhaps of not such high birth as Inouye. Nevertheless he
               
               was indignant that his generosity and interest as a
               
               benefactor to the young man, and which had procured him the
               
               position he presently occupied with the American, should be
               
               apparently imposed upon, for it seemed to Takamine, who had
               
               something of the arrogance of the wealthy Japanese, that no
               
               one but a man in his own position should aspire to his
               
               daughter's hand.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Before the great reformation of the government system,
               
               such an offer from Inouye, even in his impoverished state,
               
               would have been considered a high compliment, as he belonged
               
               to that class of people called the Shizoku (nobles), while
               
               Takamine would have been recognized merely as a citizen or
               
               rich merchant. But since the reformation all classes of
               
               people became recognized equally, and there was no line of
               
               distinction drawn whatever, save that which nobility and
               
               high position, aided by wealth, could carry out, although
               
               the nobles secretly resented the change and instinctively
               
               felt their superiority in spite of fallen fortunes.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               So Inouye bitterly thought of the refusal he had
               
               received, and with all the stubbornness of his class
               
               rebelled against it. Moreover, his heart was quite set on
               
               the girl Haru for a bride, and it was with bitter jealousy
               
               he imagined her the bride of another, for Haru was the
               
               embodiment of everything that was sweet, beautiful, dainty,
               
               and noble.

               interpreter, almost indispensable to the American, and
               
               because of the coolness and wisdom he had shown in all
               
               things, the more careless man was used to relying a great
               
               deal on his opinion. Inouye's face was rather pale.

               syndicate could build the road just as well without his
               
               purse. I simply wanted his aid with the government in
               
               getting the contract; but he was shrewd enough to smell a
               
               good thing for himself, and now, I fear, is in it to stay. I
               
               can't very well go back on him, but I'll be hanged if I care

               his capital will be almost entirely absorbed for some time,
               
               and that he will realize nothing whatever on it for some
               
               years. He'd get his money back in time, doubled, but it
               
               would take some years, perhaps, before profits would accrue
               
               and dividends be declared. The deuce is, he won't put in a
               
               small part of his fortune, but every available yen he wants

               altogether, for the syndicate and for this country. I would
               
               not spoil so large a piece of work for one person.”

               have you write the syndicate later, and in the meantime
               
               write as courteous a letter as possible to Takamine,

               that profits will be doubled for him in the end. By the way,
               
               there's no use mentioning the time when profits begin to
               
               accrue. He would not understand that, and we must have his

               It was some months before the work could be even begun
               
               on the road, for communication between America and Japan is
               
               slow, and Mr. Arthurs was obliged to submit most of his

               Takamine, various governmental concessions and privileges

               Arthurs was a queer mixture of shrewdness and weakness.
               
               With the keenness of a veteran promoter he planned out a
               
               work so extensive that it threatened to absorb all smaller
               
               railways then existing in Japan. In spite of this he
               
               depended almost entirely on Inouye for the execution of his
               
               plans, and because of his confidence in him had appointed
               
               him assistant manager of the company. The American soon
               
               found it almost impossible to take a step without the
               
               assistance of Inouye, and indeed it was Inouye who gave the
               
               orders and saw they were carried out. There was scarcely a
               
               suggestion that Inouye made which was not agreed to by
               
               Arthurs, and in this way practically the entire management
               
               lay in the hands of the Japanese.

            <div data-el="p">Everything went smoothly with the company, and the
               
               American, having put the responsibility on the shoulders of
               
               Inouye, found leisure to see something of the country itself
               
               and take interest in the people. Like most foreigners, he
               
               soon succumbed to the dolce far niente of the atmosphere,
               
               and took his pleasures in a leisurely fashion. Indeed, there
               
               are few foreigners visiting Japan who look upon the country
               
               otherwise than as almost a pleasure resort; and though they
               
               arrive with all the ambition and vigor of the West, they
               
               soon slip off their commercial coats to don those of quiet
               
               peace, restfulness, and sunshine. The ease and luxury which
               
               pervade the life of the higher class of Japanese is
               
               contagious, perhaps, to the foreigner, and the same
               
               listlessness soon makes itself manifest among them after a
               
               short residence there and when business cares press not too
               
               heavily. Of course, the merchant-class people are ever alert
               
               with a constant, keen eye for business, but this class of
               
               Japanese are seldom as attractive to the foreigner as the
               
               remnant of the old samurai class. To pleasures they are
               
               addicted. Local fêtes, flowers of every season, snow and the
               
               full moon, all these give the better classes pretexts for
               
               forming convivial parties which meet in picturesque tea-
               
               houses and drink the tiny cups of hot saké, waited upon by
               
               the dazzling, tripping waitresses, and constantly cheered
               
               and entertained by the gaiety and accomplishments of the
               
               ever-present geisha.

               With the usual abandon and extravagance of an American,
               
               Arthurs plunged into this novel and strangely fascinating
               
               life of gaiety and dissipation, which, though fully as
               
               attractive as that of his own country, yet nevertheless was
               
               seldom unhealthful, because seldom carried to excess. In
               
               fact, he grew happier and stronger under its influence. He
               
               was never bored, seldom melancholy. The geisha-girls kept
               
               him on a constant strain of mirth and sentiment, and the
               
               beauty of the scenery was restful enough for even the most
               
               weary man of the world.

               Like most foreigners, the only native women he came in
               
               contact with were merely the geisha or dancing girls, and
               
               his ideas of Japanese women were entirely founded on the
               
               life of these girls, believing them typical of the Japanese
               
               woman. And with the usual susceptibility of a young man he
               
               fell in love with a fresh face, a newer grace, a brighter
               
               eye or redder lips each day.

            <div data-el="p">It was two years later. Takamine, who had as yet had
               
               little or scarcely any return for his invested money, grew
               
               more nervous each day. He had put the greater part of his
               
               wealth in the railroad, hoping to realize a profit from it
               
               very soon. To live in the extravagant style he had always
               
               done, and give his sons and daughter fitting educations, was
               
               a constant drain on his purse, already so badly depleted by
               
               his investment. Three of his sons were abroad, being
               
               educated in foreign lands, and there remained with him only
               
               his youngest child, Haru, who was motherless. She was the
               
               sunshine of the old man's life, and he made great plans for
               
               her future. His influence with the government had not been
               
               as great of late. He had been worsted in a recent election
               
               for governor of the province. He felt he would have gained
               
               this position had he been able to spend his money more
               
               lavishly, but with so much of it tied up in stocks and bonds
               
               of the railroad he did not feel encouraged to do so.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               In the meanwhile, Arthurs' position had grown in
               
               prominence; his salary was increased threefold, and he
               
               himself was one of the largest stockholders of the company.
               
               The railroad had progressed rapidly, and already included
               
               many miles of rail.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Yet in spite of the evident prosperity of the road, and
               
               the fact that it had already begun paying a small quarterly
               
               dividend to its stockholders, Takamine's financial affairs
               
               became more straitened. He had speculated heavily, and was
               
               gambling away the remnants of his fortune. His last and only
               
               resource was his investment with the railroad, and he vainly
               
               tried to sell the bonds. The Japanese are not, as a rule, a
               
               speculative people. Had he been in America he doubtless
               
               could have sold his bonds at even more than their face
               
               value; but in Japan it was different. The people, though
               
               vastly interested in the progress of the road, were yet
               
               niggardly in putting out any of their money, and when they
               
               did, it was only in small sums. In fact, the stockholders of
               
               the road were almost entirely English and Americans, and
               
               although Takamine had put nearly forty thousand dollars into
               
               the concern (and this is a fortune in Japan), he was
               
               anything but the largest stockholder of the company; for
               
               whereas he had pain in hard cash for all his stock, many of
               
               the stockholders had either been presented with or were
               
               supposed to have worked for a good part.

               determined it should be, and it will be!” he ended,
               
               convincingly. The American whistled softly.

               American, smiling pleasantly. “Her name is Haru,” he said,

               very spring of my life. She is daughter to Takamine,” he
               
               added, briefly.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               The American sat stock-still. He remembered the
               
               incident three years before of the young man's proposal and
               
               refusal, of how he (Arthurs) had been told by Inouye to
               
               encourage the old man to invest as much as possible, and
               
               later of the pitiful state of Takamine's finances. The cold,
               
               emotionless face of his young secretary looked a trifle
               
               relentless and unscrupulous, and in a flash he understood
               
               just what the deteriorated fortunes of Takamine would mean
               
               to Inouye—deteriorated, however, only for a time, for he
               
               would eventually make immense profits on his investment.
               
               Mingled with the American's quick comprehension of the work
               
               of Inouye was a feeling of admiration at the quietness and
               
               skill with which he had carried it out, no one being
               
               sufferer therefrom save perhaps old Takamine, and he would
               
               be only for a short time. All this passed through the mind
               
               of the American with lightning rapidity. The Japanese found
               
               his slow, sharp words enigmatical when he broke the silence.

               would sweep anything aside that stood in your way in order
               
               to attain your end.”

               Inouye did not reply, and after a time the American
               
               continued, deliberately: “You will marry a bride seemingly
               
               poor, in reality wealthy. Our road is bound to be a
               
               superlative success, as you know. Her father is one of the
               
               largest stockholders, though the old fool, I believe, has
               
               grown to think his bonds so much waste paper.”

               Arthurs got up from his seat and walked up and down the
               
               room, his hands thrust in his pockets, while Inouye watched
               
               him a trifle anxiously. He stopped by Inouye's chair, and
               
               said, quite gently:

               happiness. Don't blame you, either, if you love the girl.
               
               She must be very—er—pretty and sweet for you to have
               
               waited so long and taken such pains to win her. Of course
               
               she reciprocates your affection?”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “That,” said Inouye, evasively, “will come after
               
               marriage. It is always so in Japan. We do not love before
               
               marriage. We merely expect to love.”

               the American remained in his office absently glancing over
               
               stray newspapers, though taking no note of what he read. His
               
               house adjoined his office, and his man had been over twice
               
               to call him to his supper. At the second call Arthurs locked
               
               his heavy desk, and with the keys jingling in his hand,
               
               passed absently out. But that evening he did not visit the
               
               tea-houses on the hill after supper. Instead he remained
               
               quietly indoors. His thoughts kept wandering to Inouye and
               
               his betrothed. He could not help being interested in the
               
               girl whom Inouye had been in such a hurry to defend from the
               
               imputation that she was a “female.” He smiled whimsically as
               
               he thought of this, and wondered whether she would be happy
               
               after marriage with Inouye.

               “If she is like the rest of them she will be,” he
               
               thought, half scornfully. He would not acknowledge to
               
               himself that the reason why he did not go to the tea-houses
               
               now was because of Inouye's half-contemptuous allusion to
               
               the geisha and dancing girls. It ruffled him when he
               
               recalled Inouye's remark, “But you have had no acquaintance
               
               with my countrywomen.” After all, that was true. All the
               
               Japanese women he had met had been dancing and tea-house
               
               geisha girls. He had thought them charming. He had not often
               
               come in contact with the daughters of the nobles; indeed, he
               
               could not recollect ever having seen any of them. They did
               
               not live in the city, as a rule, or when they did, they
               
               lived in great seclusion, seldom frequenting the street save
               
               on their way to the hills and mountains, when they rode past
               
               in graceful robes in their kurummas<a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a>. There were some
               
               Japanese women who worked in offices and hospitals, he had
               
               heard, but he had never spoken to any of them, and in
               
               appearance they reminded him of English and American women,
               
               as they wore European clothes, and most of them had been
               
               educated abroad. Arthurs felt a desire to know something of
               
               the real Japanese ladies of whom Inouye had spoken.

               quite a late hour. He was preparing to retire for the night
               
               when the light tapping of his man on his wall made him push
               
               back the folding fusuma<a href="#n4" data-el="ref" data-target="#n4">[4]</a>. He took the card and read the
               
               name, “Mr. I. Takamine.” The American tossed the card into a
               
               tray, and in a few minutes was with his guest.

               The old man was sitting sadly and forlornly on one of
               
               the American's rather high chairs, and because he was such a
               
               very little man he looked in the half-light almost like a
               
               child. After the usual exchange of compliments, the old man
               
               drew from under his hakama<a href="#n5" data-el="ref" data-target="#n5">[5]</a> a document. It was the betrothal
               
               contract Inouye had made out that afternoon. In trembling
               
               voice the old man inquired as to whether he had anything to
               
               expect from his investment soon, and upon the assurance of
               
               the American, said in halting English, “Then can this not

               was unacquainted with the language was unable to make out
               
               what it meant until Takamine said:

               money on this invest I will marry my daughter to Mr. Inouye.
               
               And if I not lose my invest I keep her with me, and marry
               
               her to some man with much rich also. So I come ask you that
               
               I lose my invest.”

               The American listened to him gravely, and when he had
               
               finished speaking he said:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “But Inouye is hardly a poor man. He is practically the
               
               manager of the whole business here, and is, in fact,
               
               receiving quite a large salary. He might make your daughter
               
               a very good husband. He is honest, conscientious, and—but
               
               you doubtless know his character and good qualities. His
               
               prospects are good at present.”

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “No,” the American interrupted, a trifle provoked. “I
               
               merely wanted to explain things to you. You see, when Inouye
               
               first came to me he was poor enough. His services have been
               
               invaluable to me. The road has kept growing, and I have
               
               advanced him considerably; and I judge from the clever way
               
               in which he looks after the work he is in a fair way to

               Takamine looked very much impressed, as the American's
               
               words always went a great way with all who knew him. He rose
               
               to his feet, bowing politely and humbly.

               benevolent.

               As he passed out, bowing at every step, the American

               “I suppose he'll barter her to the highest bidder.” The
               
               thought made him restless through the night. He felt an
               
               instinctive pity and sympathy for Haru, as he remembered how
               
               Inouye had refused to give him a direct answer as to whether
               
               she cared for him; and now the father had lifted the veil a
               
               bit, and he had a conception of the mute rebellion the girl
               
               must have shown.

            <div data-el="p">Haru's little heart was very heavy, and there was no
               
               gaiety in her smile, which was pathetic and sad. Her father
               
               tried to rally her out of her sadness, telling her that soon
               
               he was going to betroth her to a young man who was good,
               
               fine-looking, of noble parentage, and who would perhaps give
               
               her all the luxuries she had always known. But the girl
               
               protested pitifully, declaring she wanted not to be married,
               
               and that her heart was set on going to her brothers, and
               
               receiving, like them, a foreign education. Haru belonged to
               
               that type of Japanese woman rarely seen in Japan save in the
               
               homes of the noble and wealthy. Her mother had been of noble
               
               parentage, and it was from her the girl inherited her innate
               
               modesty and native beauty and grace. Like most Japanese
               
               women, she was small; her face was oval, the features very
               
               regular, with small mouth, and eyes that had a pathetic,
               
               subdued look about them. But her eyes were larger than the
               
               average Japanese eye, being wide as the Shizoku ladies'
               
               usually are. Her little hands and feet would have served as
               
               artists' models, and the soft, rounded neck that rose
               
               gracefully above her kimono was slender, with a grace and
               
               strength that made it wonderfully pleasing and attractive.
               
               Although she had attended the finest schools for girls, she
               
               was still wishful for a higher education, which her father
               
               had been slow in gratifying owing to his desire to make an
               
               early marriage for her. Haru was past eighteen, and quite
               
               old enough to marry. Her father spoke to her constantly on
               
               the subject, and since his interview with the American, and
               
               others he had had since with him and with Inouye, he had
               
               ever been urging her to marry Inouye. He loved her very
               
               dearly, and did not wish to force her into a marriage that
               
               would be obnoxious to her, but he was determined that she
               
               should, as soon as he could get her reconciled, become
               
               formally betrothed to some one before she reached her
               
               nineteenth year.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “He will make a good husband,” he told her of Inouye
               
               many times a day, and the girl would say:

            <div data-el="p">

               the old man very much, and he would make harsh answer:

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Not any one, my father,” the girl would say, clinging
               
               to him. “Let me stay by you, and take care of you when you
               
               shall be very old.”

               because you are fair and my daughter, you must marry and

            <div data-el="p">One day, when the air was very still, and the cherry-
               
               blossoms were falling from the trees, and the very birds
               
               hushed their little breaths because of the beauty of the
               
               scene, and then thrilled of a sudden with their joy, the
               
               American visited at the house of Takamine. The old man was
               
               quite flattered, for the American had become a very big man
               
               in the city, and every one honored and loved him because of
               
               his kindness to all. Haru was playing Karutta<a href="#n6" data-el="ref" data-target="#n6">[6]</a> at the side
               
               of the house with a friend, and as the American's tall
               
               figure passed up the little garden walk to the house, the
               
               girls nimbly stepped out of view, though they peeped
               
               curiously at him from behind a bank of wisteria and ferns.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Takamine lived quite a good distance from the city. The
               
               American was invited in the most polite manner to enter the
               
               house and spend the afternoon with the old man indoors. He
               
               saw nothing of the daughter, though once or twice he fancied
               
               he heard a ripple of laughter in the next room. Finally he
               
               asked his host bluntly whether he could not see Haru. The
               
               old man bowed politely, and said she would appear at the
               
               dinner-table.  Just when the sun began to tip over the hills
               
               some one drew aside the sliding fusuma screens between the
               
               rooms, and the American saw before him a pretty, bright room
               
               and a couple of maids preparing the dinner. His host bade
               
               him enter this room, and as he passed through he saw a
               
               little form clad in a rose-colored kimono with red flowers
               
               in her hair sitting on a mat. He could not see her face at
               
               first because her head was bending almost to the floor in
               
               her greeting to her father's guest. The old man introduced
               
               them, and once more the girl's little head almost touched
               
               the ground.

            <div data-el="p">Arthurs had never before dined at a Japanese private
               
               house, though he had now been three years in the country. He
               
               had lived like most foreigners who come to the country—half
               
               the time at the American hotel, and half the time in his
               
               Japanese-American house. As he gravely took his seat on a
               
               mat placed for him, he saw Haru's face. The eyes were
               
               downcast and refused to look at him. The man's heart rose in
               
               his throat, for she was very beautiful. From the floor,
               
               padded perhaps five feet with soft rice-straw, to the
               
               exquisite walls, the rich silk robes of Haru and her father,
               
               the dainty china placed before him, Arthurs recognized the
               
               home of Japanese wealth. He could not have told what he ate.
               
               He had made a solemn resolve to follow the national
               
               etiquette and eat all placed before him, and this he did in
               
               the most heroic manner. Often through the meal he found his
               
               eyes wandering to the girl, as she lifted her little bowl of
               
               rice with one hand and daintily manipulated the chop-sticks
               
               with the other.

            <div data-el="p">Although Takamine spoke a great deal to him through the
               
               meal, the girl never once addressed him. Once Arthurs
               
               himself addressed her, asking if she had ever met an
               
               American lady, and the girl had turned her face to her
               
               father, who replied for her, saying that she had had an
               
               American teacher once who had taught her the language and
               
               physical exercises.

               Arthurs found himself wishing to hear her say
               
               something, and impatiently wondered to himself whether she
               
               was dumb.

               After the dinner they retired into the room where he
               
               had formerly sat. Then Haru lit sticks of incense in the
               
               room, and brought trays with cigarettes for her father and
               
               the American. She herself found a seat in the shadow, where
               
               the American could not see her well, though he felt that her
               
               turn was now come, and that, shaded in her retreat, she was
               
               studying and observing him as he sat awkwardly in Japanese
               
               fashion.

            <div data-el="p">After this first visit Arthurs came with fair
               
               regularity for some time, and soon became a welcome and
               
               familiar guest of the house. His persistence in his calls
               
               had been more than repaid, for now Haru was permitted to
               
               talk a little with him, though always in the presence of her
               
               father. She would glide about in the room in the prettiest
               
               ways, bringing odd, comfortable cushions and wraps for her
               
               father and guest to sit on. But the greatest treat the
               
               American had was one night when her father had bidden her
               
               bring her samisen<a href="#n7" data-el="ref" data-target="#n7">[7]</a>, and she had played ever so gently on it,
               
               and sang to them in the moonlight in a weird, sweet voice,
               
               which was plaintive with longing and so subdued that it gave
               
               one a suggestion of the woman heart beneath. Arthurs had
               
               heard the Japanese geisha-girls sing before, and many of
               
               them had sung much like this, but he did not know it,
               
               because they had not the same interest and fascination for
               
               him, with all their brilliancy, as this gentle little
               
               Japanese lady, who obeyed the enforced rules and etiquette
               
               of her class.

               The American was in love in earnest this time. He
               
               forgot all about Inouye, all about the promises he had made
               
               to him to become more familiar with the father so that he
               
               might have more power in making him take the boy as son-in-
               
               law. He knew only that Haru's voice was sweeter than
               
               anything he had ever heard, that her little shiny head was
               
               prettier than anything he had ever seen, and that she was
               
               the most desirable thing on earth.

               the men choose their wives. That is,” he corrected himself,

               trembled.

               pleasure they generally conversed in that language.

               “Here,” said Takamine, with conviction that his own
               
               country was wiser, “our daughters marry whom we choose for

               simply, and the girl's wistful face relaxed.

            <div data-el="p">It was six months since the date on which Inouye had
               
               drawn up his betrothal contract and had presented it to
               
               Takamine. During this time the American had become an almost
               
               daily visitor at Takamine's house, and the old man was quite
               
               seriously under obligations to him, for at a time when he
               
               found his resources were running down to a low ebb he had
               
               half apologetically offered his bonds for sale to the
               
               American himself. This Arthurs rather brusquely refused,
               
               assuring the old man that the profits would eventually be
               
               such that he felt Takamine ought to wait still awhile
               
               longer, but knowing of his absolute present need for money,
               
               he advanced Takamine a sum of money, asking no security
               
               therefor whatever. Takamine told Haru that he was under
               
               eternal obligations to the American. He knew of only one way
               
               in which he felt he could give genuine pleasure to him—that
               
               was to grant his request, made some months ago, giving his
               
               daughter in marriage to Inouye, the friend of the American.
               
               As her father recounted all the kindness he had received
               
               from the American, and enlarged on it, Haru answered never a
               
               word, but sat very pale and quiet, her eyes looking far out
               
               with an expression of longing and sadness in them that the
               
               old man could not fathom. When the father asked her if she
               
               would not now be a dutiful daughter and help him to fill his
               
               obligations, she passively assented, smiling so gently and
               
               meekly that the father put his hand lovingly on her head,
               
               and said she was ever his dutiful and loving daughter.

               signing a batch of letters that Inouye had dictated to the
               
               stenographer, Inouye, who stood at his elbow, said very
               
               softly:

               some private business.”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               The American pushed the letters aside, and looked up at
               
               the young man with his usual kind, attentive smile.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Well, Inouye,” I'm at leisure now,” he said,
               
               encouragingly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Inouye looked at him the least bit uneasily, and then
               
               began to thank him in the formal words of a Japanese to his
               
               benefactor for his kindly offices in his behalf, finally
               
               telling the American of his betrothal to Haru. The American
               
               did not interrupt him once as he spoke, but the keen eyes of
               
               the Japanese saw a gray shadow creep over his face.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               When Inouye had finished, the American wheeled slowly
               
               around on his chair. He had no word of comment to make.
               
               Suddenly he got up abruptly from his seat and crossed to the
               
               door. He stood looking out at the endless glow of the
               
               Oriental landscape with a sudden tightening of his heart-
               
               strings, with a pain that was terrible in its numbness and
               
               helplessness. A couple of doves in a neighboring cote were
               
               crooning mournfully, and two little geisha-girls waved their
               
               hands joyously at him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               He was thinking of Haru, just as Inouye had done three
               
               years before, and he had forgotten his interpreter and his
               
               work—forgotten all save that the joyous daydream in which
               
               he had reveled ever since that first day he had met her was
               
               all passing away, and that life was not worth the living now
               
               that it had ceased.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               The Japanese watched him with a penetrating look.
               
               Perhaps he guessed the truth. He could not restrain the half
               
               smile of triumph as he realized how he had worsted the
               
               American. A formal betrothal in Japan is almost as binding
               
               as a marriage. When the gifts are exchanged in token of
               
               engagement the pair live on, each feeling they belong to the
               
               other, and as a rule the time is very short between the
               
               betrothal and the marriage ceremony.

               Inouye did not break in on his master's reverie. On the
               
               contrary, he returned to his desk, and started at his work
               
               in his usual methodical way. After a time the American also
               
               returned to his desk, and the Japanese, glancing sideways at
               
               him, saw him nervously fingering a half-withered red flower.
               
               It had lain on the American's desk for some days, and no one
               
               had removed it.

               face was quite pale. No word passed between them beyond a
               
               few questions and answers about the work. Perhaps the
               
               American shrank ever so slightly as his secretary stood by

               deep indignation and rage against Inouye. He knew Inouye had

               tears Arthurs had seen in Japan clouded her eyes, and shone
               
               glistening there. Had he misinterpreted that look when he
               
               had imagined she had half reproached him, and if she wished
               
               to reproach him then, did his heart not tell him it was
               
               because she knew he loved her?

               welcomed his guest as courteously as ever. Haru was nowhere
               
               in sight, and the American felt strangely weak and hardly
               
               knew himself what he had come for.

               become so familiar and dear to him, and he felt the same
               
               strangling at his heart as when Inouye had broken the news
               
               to him. But his pain gave him speech this time.

               by the way it was shaking Arthurs knew some one was standing
               
               close to it listening. Then a little broken voice trilled

               American, who had become accustomed to such things in Japan,
               
               and knew that any one in the next room in a Japanese house
               
               could hear and through small holes see as plainly as if in
               
               the same room. He turned and faced the direction of the
               
               voice, saying:

               storm; and he added, ambiguously, “Do as you please that you

               perfectly still, her back turned to them, an odd little
               
               figure with head drooping half in shame, though she showed a
               
               strange willingness to stay with them.
