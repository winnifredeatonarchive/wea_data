                  The words and the voice, with its fascinating accent,
                  took me back, in thought at least, to a country far across
                  the sea. I should have been entering a little house with a
                  deep blue or pink roof, with sliding walls of paper shoji,
                  wide spaces of shining matting, soft tatamis on which to
                  kneel. My hostess would be serving me tea in a tiny
                  handleless cup, and perhaps there would be a sweetmeat or
                  fruit on my plate, perhaps a little omelet formed in the
                  shape of a blossom. We would sit on the floor and sip our
                  tea and discuss the flower decoration in the slender vase or
                  the history of the kakemona scroll in the Tokonoma (Place of
                  Honor).

                  But no! I was not in Japan. I was entering a very
                  ordinary little American house. At the door, smiling and
                  bowing, were Mr. And Mrs. Sojin Kamiyama.<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>

               <h3>Doug Grabbed Him</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">All the world that goes to the movies has seen Sojin;
                  for since Douglas Fairbanks “discovered” the Japanese actor
                  and engaged him to play the Mongolian Prince in “The Thief
                  of Bagdad,” Sojin has supported the most prominent of the
                  stars. He will be recalled as the toothless Jewish jeweler
                  in “The Wanderer,” as the dapper, wise-cracking Americanized
                  Chinaman in “The Road to Mandalay,” as the coolie in “The
                  Sea Beast,” the Caliph in “The Lady of the Harem.” He was in
                  “Eve's Leaves,” had a prominent part in “The Bat,” and stole
                  the picture in “The Chinese Parrot.” He was in “East of
                  Suez,” “Proud Flesh” and numerous other well-known
                  productions.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  I had never been sure of Sojin's nationality. Now that
                  I had a “close-up,” as they say in pictures, of the man, I
                  still wondered. Then he told me he was born in Sendai, near
                  Matsushima Bay. Came enlightenment. Twenty-five hundred
                  years ago there was a Mongol invasion in that part of Japan.
                  An ancient memorial stone still proclaims the feat of the
                  Mongols. Though they perished, they left their imprint and
                  stamp upon the faces of the inhabitants of that region.
                  Sojin might be a Tartar or Mongol. He is above the average
                  height, has large eyes, a high nose and a sensitive mouth.

               <h3>Famous Across the Sea</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">To start the conversation, I remarked that I had heard
                  of his fame as an actor and producer in Japan. Sojin looked
                  alarmed, glanced at his wife, made a deprecating motion and
                  assured me his fame was “very little.” Then something
                  unusual in a Japanese household occurred. Mrs. Sojin
                  contradicted her husband, something no obedient wife would
                  ever dare to do in Japan.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah! Is ver' greatest fame at Japan,” she said.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Sojin looked disturbed and uncomfortable.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Excuse,” he said, and then added swiftly, no doubt to
                  placate his wife: “I speak not very kind English. My wife
                  speak very good.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  I asked him whether in Japan he had produced the old
                  classical dramas.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Only at beginning of career. I am of very modern
                  school, madame,” he explained.
               </div>
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="72"/>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">His wife put in eagerly: “My husband first pioneer in
                  new drama movement—Little theater, you understand. He make
                  first production in Shakespeare, Ibsen, Sudermann, Goethe—
                  many other—one hundred other!”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  I tried to imagine a Japanese audience watching a
                  performance of “The Doll's House,” The Master Builder,”
                  “Hedda Gabler,” “The Merchant of Venice,” “Hamlet,”
                  “Othello,” “Anthony and Cleopatra,” “Faust,” and the
                  Russian, German, and French plays, all of which were
                  included in Sojin's repertory.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Were these European plays successful?”

               <div data-el="p">
                  “Very so,” said Sojin. Again Mrs. Sojin interposed,
                  eagerly: “Always plenty people come to theater. High class
                  people—intelligentsia—artist, writer, student, scholar.
                  All very hungry see my husband in European drama.”
               </div>

               <h3>He Knew His Foreigners</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">Sojin here explained the really monumental task
                  achieved in studying and producing these plays in Japan.
                  There would be foreign companies touring there, and playing
                  in the chief cities. He would go to every performance,
                  intensively study the plays and the style of the acting. He
                  was, moreover, a pupil of Professor Tsubuchi, at Waseda
                  University, the scholar who translated into Japanese not
                  only Shakespeare, but Ibsen and the Russian, German, and
                  French classics.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Sojin explained that he produced some of these plays as
                  Japanese. That is to say, he would transpose the originals
                  and adapt them so that the scene was Japan and the
                  characters Japanese. Thus Hamlet became Prince Hamura
                  Tashimura, son of the reigning Daimyo (Lord or Prince) of a
                  great feudal Province. Othello was a new-rich Prince, of
                  Pariah ancestry, as he was descended from the despised Eta
                  race. Desdemona was a Princess of high Patrician blood.
                  “King Lear” was a favorite with the Japanese. Sojin was
                  inclined to think that the plays of Shakespeare bore a
                  resemblance to many of the old Japanese classics.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  The stage is a subject near to the heart of Sojin, but
                  I presently brought the subject around to motion pictures.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Are the movies popular in Japan? Do the Japanese like
                  American pictures?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Sojin is slow at replying. He weighs a question and
                  sorts out his words. Then he answers with something of a
                  flash as if the answer had just occurred to him.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah! How like movie at Japan? Very much same as
                  American first like chop suey. You understand?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  We laugh in complete understanding, but Mrs. Sojin puts
                  in almost breathlessly: “It is give shock, very strange,
                  queer, liddle bit suspicious, but very much like little
                  while.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Sojin who has come somewhat out of his shell by now,
                  likens the movie craze in Japan to an epidemic. Everybody
                  goes to the movies. The favorite stars are Charlie Chaplin,
                  Lillian Gish, Nazimova, Fairbanks and Hoot Gibson.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “How do Japanese audiences react to the sex element in
                  American pictures?” I ask.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Sojin considers. He has recourse to his wife. They
                  whisper a bit in Japanese, and then Mrs. Sojin in English:
                  “Sex—it is American make—Love—kiss—embrace.” She
                  illustrates, quite eloquently, with her hands. Sojin nods
                  and blinks with dazed comprehension. Then she continues:
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Well, Japanese audience get one shock after one
                  another on American play. He's adjust to new kind shock. He
                  is shock, struck, kick, shooted at. All very different
                  Japanese ideal. Very much bewilder and delicious fright.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  A pause, thoughtful on Sojin's part. Then leaning
                  forward, with his long sensitive hands flattened together,
                  he says: “Very significant thing I confide you. Three year
                  ago ninety per cent. Japanese people want foreign picture.
                  Ten per cent. ask Japanese picture. Today he is changing.
                  Eight per cent. Japanese people ask for Japanese picture.
                  Twenty per cent. demand foreign.”

               <div data-el="p">
                  Mrs. Sojin deprecates this revelation.

               <div data-el="p">It is a pleasure, it is delightful to hear Mrs. Sojin's
                  naïve and quaint speech. She has a most engaging smile and
                  her slightly high cheek bones are flushed rosily. It is she
                  who is careful to get in the information anent her husband's
                  ancestry and education. His family were samurai under the
                  Princes of Date. His father was a scholar. Sojin was
                  graduated at Waseda University. Also he learned “the arts of
                  picture” at the Tokyo Fine Arts School. It is worth while
                  quoting Mrs. Sojin verbatim:

                  charming leading lady, now Mrs. Sojin Kamiyama. Sojin is
                  inclined to be diffident. He has that rare quality possessed
                  by a true artist—modesty.

                  Before I leave I put a last question:

               <div data-el="p">
                  “Mr. Sojin, do you think Japan and America will ever be
                  at war?”

                  Sojin's eyes dilate indignantly. Then “Impossible!
                  Japan cherishes intelligence. What for would she destroy
                  what she has built? It is for interest both America and
                  Japan be friends.”

                  Mrs. Sojin runs down the terrace after me. She puts a
                  package in my hand. A little souvenir of Japan. I look back
                  at little Mrs. Sojin, and in the language of the movies, the
                  scene “lap dissolves” out and into Sojin and his wife in
                  Japanese costume. The terraces are lined with plum trees in
                  spring blossom and the house on the hill “fades” into the
                  outlines of a pagoda. I can hear the wind bells tinkling in
                  a faint breeze.
