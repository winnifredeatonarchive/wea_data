            <div data-el="div" data-type="part">
               
               <div data-el="p">“How you do, Madame?”</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Maurice Chevalier beamed upon me with professional
                  cordiality.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Bon jour, m'sieu,” said I.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  An electrical change swept Chevalier's face. He gazed
                  at me with delighted amazement.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah-h-h-h-! Vous parlez francais?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  But my greeting had used up my entire French
                  vocabulary. Now Chevalier took me for granted: I was not a
                  stranger but a friend. A stream of voluble French poured
                  from him as he drew me into his dressing-room. His smile was
                  warm. Perhaps I might even be a French-woman. At all events
                  I made an excellent listener; I can listen in all languages.
                  I couldn't help myself, for by this time I was afraid to
                  open my mouth. I didn't want to break the spell. I'd have
                  given a lot at that very moment to be able to understand
                  what Chevalier was saying. Everything in a foreign language
                  sounds thrilling, sensational.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  When finally Chevalier comprehended the limitations of
                  my vocabulary, he regarded me with an element of regret and
                  reproach. However, he was French, even if he does look like
                  a big, blond, very He-ish Englishman, and he politely turned
                  his disappointment into a bow.

            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="div" data-type="part">
               
               <h3>Beyond Publicity</h3>
               
               <div data-el="p">“You don't like interviews, do you?” I asked.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  He made an expressive motion with his hands, slightly
                  shrugged. At least his gestures are typically Latin.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “In France,” he said, “I am no longer interviewed. My
                  fame is establish'. I am Maurice Chevalier. It is enough—
                  for Paris. But here—everyt'ing is publicity—yes?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  At this juncture, we were interrupted by Director
                  Wallace, a large, handsome young dynamo, who thrust his head
                  in, in passing.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Publicity is a get-famous-quick method,” he bellowed.
                  “Fame is a female. You've got to chase her.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “How you catch her?” asked Chevalier.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “All sorts of ways and means. Some people make a
                  profession of notoriety. Now as for you—well, you might
                  divorce your wife and that'd get you on the front page.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah, no! I do not like the front page. I like better my
                  wife—even if obscurity.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Director Wallace went off laughing. “There's French
                  gallantry for you,” was his parting shot. Chevalier, with a
                  wry smile and a shake of his head, said:
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “He likes poke joke.”
               </div>
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="div" data-type="part">
               
               <h3>How Frenchmen End It</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">“But Frenchmen are naturally very gallant, aren't
                  they?” What better subject to talk to a Latin of than love?
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “It is their birthright,” said Chevalier. “It is in the
                  bone and blood of the Frenchman. He is courteous even to a
                  scrubwoman. When he terminates a love affair, he does it
                  with finesse. He leaves a regret behind—it is fragrance of
                  memory. Is not that better than a bitterness?
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “He makes an art of love. It is done in little, fine
                  ways, you understand. His attitude to women is always
                  deferential, tender, admiring. It makes the ladies feel very
                  good.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “But is it not insincere?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “No, not insincere, for while he speaks or looks at the
                  
                  
                  <hr data-el="pb" data-n="116"/>
                  
                  woman, he means what he looks and speaks. His heart is
                  impressionable. He loves for the moment. All his life, the
                  Frenchman loves—even when little boy. When he grows to man,
                  he is in chronic love. Maybe he has many little love
                  affairs. He does not despise—‘Un Peu d'Amour.’ You know the
                  song, Madame? It is French. It means ‘A Little Love.’ Not
                  the grande passion, you understand, which comes but once in
                  a man's life—but—un peu d'amour.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Chevalier beamed. He was feeling very pleased with
                  himself I think, and he began to tell me of the little
                  gallantries and courtesies that women love. It may be only a
                  look of admiration—perhaps the gift of a bouquet; the
                  manner in which he lifts his hat; his deferential bow. A
                  woman loves a compliment as a kitten does cream. To say to a
                  woman: Ah, you are looking charming today, mademoiselle, is
                  to make her feel better for all the rest of that day.
                  Dainty, fastidious, exquisite, unobtrusive little attentions—a woman will always react
                  to these. Yes, undoubtedly, the
                  Frenchman was the supreme lover of the world.

               <h3>As to Kissing Hands</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">“They are great hand-kissers,” I observed.</div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “No, that is a mistake. I have seen more foreigners—
                  Americans and Englishmen in Paris—who kiss the hand than
                  the French. That is a custom only upon formal occasion—or
                  maybe in some high society. To me it seems like affectation—artificial.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “But Menjou does it.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah! Menjou. But he is a movie Frenchman. Pardon! I
                  mean that in the movie picture perhaps he makes the kiss on
                  the hand. I very much admire Menjou. He is an amiable and
                  charming gentleman and a talented actor.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  He changed the subject and began to talk of Hollywood.
                  Like everyone else when he first comes here, he had heard
                  the tales of the wild parties and sex escapades. For his
                  part Chevalier had not seen that side of Hollywood, but
                  then, quoth he, he was a man of simple, even bourgeois,
                  tastes. He was not very fast, he admitted almost
                  apologetically. Money, so he thinks, is not important. It
                  comes—it goes. We should not make a fetish of it. The most
                  desirable things in life are security, tranquility, peace of
                  mind—love, love of wife and dear ones—love of friends.
                  Like most foreign stars, he referred to Douglas Fairbanks
                  and Mary, his wife, as the ideal pair. They had set a
                  standard of living that those less famous might well
                  emulate.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Assuredly, Madame,” he added, “it is finer to make an
                  art of living rather than merely succeed upon the screen or
                  stage.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  Didn't he think, I hinted, that American girls are the
                  most beautiful in the world?
               </div>

               <h3>There are Many Beauties</h3>
               
               
               <div data-el="p">“Madame,” said Chevalier. “No country has secured a
                  corner on beauty. There are beautiful women everywhere. But—the United States, she
                  is a remarkable country—very great—very rich.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “I have heard you described as the Al Jolson of
                  Europe,” said I, beginning to gather up gloves, bag, vanity—the impedimenta of the
                  feminine interviewer.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  “Ah no, no,” he denied quickly. “Al Jolson is supreme
                  in America. I lift my hat with respect to such an artist. As
                  for me—I am just—Chevalier. But I hope America will like
                  me a little. If so, I shall stay here—but every summer I
                  will return to my Paris. We have a popular song—‘Ah qu'il
                  était bon, mon village—mon Paris’—‘How beautiful my village
                  is—my Paris.’”
