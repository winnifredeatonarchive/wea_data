               <div data-el="p">American married men very easy to take from wife,” said Camilla Horn. “I could get
                  any husband if I want. On'y I don' want!”

                  	Camilla is unique. Camilla is extraordinary. Camilla is unbelievable. No publicity
                  genius speaks for Camilla. Imagine a publicity man making such a statement as that.
                  She may indeed be said to be the enfant terrible of the United Artists lot, for off
                  the screen Camilla cannot act or pose.

                  	She came into the room with a rush, on the heels of the studio executive who introduced
                  us. She was wearing an unlovely drab colored muskrat coat and her natural blonde hair
                  was tucked under a tight little toque. I thought at first her eyes were the color
                  of the Danube, but then she told me they were “Any color you like. Maybe brown, blue—green.”
                  They are changing eyes, black-lashed, wide and clear. She grasped my hand, smiled
                  at me eagerly:
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“Ach! I t'ink maybe I have also already met you before? No? So many writers I have
                  meet. It is a great pleasure some time. When first I come from Germany, big crowd
                  from newspapers meet me, and I cannot speak English. So they look at me and I see
                  on their face what they think: 'Ach! This Camilla Horn—she is dumb!'”

               <div data-el="p">
                  	I laughed, I don't know why; and after a moment she joined in heartily. We became
                  instant friends. Camilla put her arm around my shoulders, as if we had known each
                  other for years and, “Come,” said Camilla, “I will feed you.”

                  von Stroheim<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> served us a colossal meal. Camilla studied me thoughtfully. What was I thinking of
                  her? Her fair candid brows knitted. She spoke with genuine regret upon the end of
                  a sigh.

                  	“Everybody t'ink of me that I am—dumb! You, too? Is because I do not mix so well.
                  I go to some party, I sit in some quiet corner, I do not make the handspring or dance
                  the jazzy bottom. So then they say: 'Ach! She is

                  no fun. She is dumb.' But is not true. I am not dumb,” said Camilla Horn with intense
                  earnestness.

                  I go to work. I have little brother and mother to feed . . . What did I do?” She lowered
                  her voice confidentially. There was a warm, friendly look in her now brown eyes. “I
                  will tell you what I do. I make pajamas. I design them. I sew on them. I go out to
                  store and I sell them.”

                     as an actor (playing stiff, aristocratic Prussian soldier types) and then as a perfectionist
                     director whose films, while beautiful, always came in late and far over budget. His
                     masterpiece <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Greed</span> (1924), for example, originally came in at over seven hours, and his directing career
                     was effectively ended when he was fired from <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Queen Kelly</span> (1929) by producer Gloria Swanson after spending $600,000 (an exorbitant amount in
                     1929 dollars). Eaton's allusion is prescient, given the role von Stroheim would play
                     when he reunited with Swanson in <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Sunset Boulevard</span> (1950): the aging movie star's butler.

                  “One day Mr. Murnau<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> sees me on street. He stop and look hard. He say: 'You are Marguerite for my Faust.'
                  I laugh and say: 'Is silly. I am not lovely like Marguerite.' He replies that I come
                  to his studio next day. Still I think it a joke and I do not tell my mother, but I
                  go. That day he signs me up on contract. Is for beeg money. Seem oh, so big to me

                  a little tie for his neck, and she puts by his plate a little brush-teeth. Mary's
                  father does not come, and her face when sees other cop-man—it was very great acting.
