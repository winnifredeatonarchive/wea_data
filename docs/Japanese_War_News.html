            <div data-el="p">In Japan, story-telling is an old and popular calling.
               The professional story-tellers have their particular halls
               where at the present moment hundreds congregate to listen to
               war news. True, the Japanese story-teller does not attract
               the more refined or highly educated people, but so popular
               is he with the masses (who can seldom afford to attend the
               theatre), that he may be classed among the most interesting
               of those who live to please and instruct.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In a sense the Japanese news-teller is an educator.
               While he embellishes and changes and adds to the facts of
               his narrative, he still faithfully presents historical and
               patriotic stories, of which his audience might otherwise
               never have heard, having neither time nor means to attain
               information about their country's status. Compulsory
               education has existed in Japan only within late years and,
               of course, there are a great many illiterate people. They
               may, by attending the story-teller's hall, keep posted on
               current topics of the day, and just now the Japanese-Russian
               war is the sole subject of their discourses. No sensational
               occurrence ever escapes the public story-teller. Thus it
               happens that the people drop into a story-teller's hall to
               “hear the news,” just as they would read it had they a
               newspaper, with this difference, that the story-teller, by
               his imagery and genius, amuses and entertains them far more
               than would the perusal of the same news in a printed sheet.
               The charge for admission to a story-teller's hall is very
               small—five sen (five cents). Cushions and fire-boxes for
               tobacco are had for a trifling extra charge.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The evening performance opens at 6:30 p.m. and ends at
               10. First, a novitiate takes his seat on the dais and tells
               a story. He, however, more by his antics and buffoonery than
               the quality of his story, will raise the amused interest of
               the audience. After he has had his turn, five or six skilled
               story-tellers follow. Then comes the “star” performer of the
               evening, who occupies the dais until his narrative falls to
               a close. The first thing a story-teller does after sitting
               on his cushion is to snuff the candle in front of him and
               take a long drink of hot water. The object of this manoeuver
               is to prolong the suspense of his audience. Most of the
               story-tellers have comical habits of sneezing, rubbing their
               noses, making grimaces before they begin to speak, which
               generally has the effect of putting their auditors on good
               terms with themselves.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The better class of narrators usually presents to his
               auditors a single continuous story, adding much matter to
               enliven it and delighting to break off at the most exciting
               point. The present war narrations take on the nature of a
               serial story and in every case the audience becomes so
               intensely interested that none fail to attend night after
               night.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In front of each story-teller's hall is
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="140"/>
               
               a square framed lantern, the largest of any hung from the
               various stores or places of amusement in the streets. The
               lantern hangs at right angles to the street, and its flat
               faces are covered with the names of the elocutionary
               entertainers, which may be read from either end of the road.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               On entering a story-teller's hall, one finds himself in
               a small court, on the walls of which are rows of pegs for
               hanging sandals, shoes or clogs. From this court the
               spectator passes into the big, matted hall, at the extreme
               end of which is the platform or dais, elevated about five
               feet.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The tradespeople, artisans, and common citizens who
               make up the audience and find a relaxation and source of
               amusement after their hard day's work, delight in the blood-
               curdling character of stories of the present Japanese
               battles, victories, and defeats. In fact, it is as much in
               the telling of a story as for its own merit upon which the
               interest of the audience hangs. When a story is in progress,
               the wicks of the hundreds of candles throughout the hall are
               gradually extinguished, and as the story is concluded, the
               last one flickers out, whereupon the room is left in total
               darkness. Naturally, the most popular of these tales are
               Japanese versions of recent Russian defeats.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The history of Japan is full of intestine wars, and
               when other subjects are wanting these furnish plenty of
               effective material for the story-teller. The long feud
               between the rival clans of Taira and Minamoto, which ended
               in the establishment of the Shogunate by the latter in 1868,
               is a favorite. It is recounted in the Taiheiki, a work of
               small value as a history, but written in fascinating style
               by one who lived in those times. It teems with adventure,
               romance, and poetry, and is favored alike by scholar,
               soldier, and common citizen. The fortunes, pride,
               prosperity, and arrogance of the great Taira clan and its
               final fall and utter extermination make touchingly pathetic
               and truly romantic plots and situations. This style of story
               usually draws an audience of young men, and inspires them to
               emulate the heroes of the valorous deeds narrated.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Seizaemon, of the Castle-gate, was the earliest known
               of story-tellers in Japan. He was a highly cultured man
               whose fortunes had fallen. He took up his position on a
               little knoll near one of the castle gates where he head
               Taiheiki and explained the difficult passages. He always
               drew “crowded houses,” and imitators fast sprang up. Other
               and less known works were also taken up, the reader,
               however, depending largely on his own imagination and
               invention, so that fiction overshadowed and almost usurped
               history.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               However, this class of story-tellers, who only read
               from the Taiheiki, did not seem to appeal with equal force
               to the masses as a later class of story-tellers called the
               Rakugoka, or narrators of stories ending with a word play.
               While the Rakugoka is in one sense a jester, he is not
               altogether a quibbler, for his tales teem with pathos,
               though their chief quality is humor.

               In the seventeenth century “A Cure for Drowsiness” was
               written for a nobleman by one Anrakuan Sakuden, a noted
               raconteur of his time, and it is from this remarkable book
               that the class of story-tellers called the Rakugoka draw
               upon for their material, though, of course, it is changed to
               suit the times.

            <div data-el="p">
               Fukai Shikoden was the first to give this style of
               story-telling popularity. He was an itinerant priest having
               been driven from the temple through the jealousy of his
               brother acolytes. He took to story-telling as a profession
               and introduced this new method with peculiar success. His
               tales were disfigured with immoralities, but, nevertheless,
               they drew immense crowds. He was the most erudite story-
               teller of his time and established the Rakugoku's position
               among the story-tellers. He died at the age of eighty-three,
               in the year 1764.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The first story-teller's hall was erected about a
               century ago. In 1815, there were seventy-five of them in
               Yedo, and
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="141"/>
               
               in ten years there were fifty more. There came a royal edict
               at one period, but this prohibition was strongly combatted
               and the story-tellers, in defiance of the law, blocked the
               streets and carried on their profession in the open. The
               government, perceiving the futility of suppressing public
               curiosity, repealed the law in 1851, and the halls prospered
               once more.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               High-grade story-tellers are comparatively few, and the
               really good talkers make an excellent living. A good story-
               teller employs his own assistants and disciples. The
               proprietor of the hall receives half the profits, and the
               story-teller pays his own assistants out of his own pockets.
               These supernumeraries receive such a very small
               consideration for their services that they seldom depend
               entirely on it as a means of livelihood, but, following some
               vocation in the day time, take to story-telling at night as
               much as a means of relaxation and a desire to hear their own
               voices in public, as for profit. Most story-tellers speak at
               two halls in a single evening. A popular favorite will make
               a great deal of money apart from what he gets out of these
               performances. He will derive a fair income from his patrons
               who call him to their houses or to tea-houses where he
               entertains them. He also receives douceurs from third or
               fourth rate men anxious to join his company and gain
               prestige.

            <div data-el="p">
               The story-tellers are invariably men, and while women
               are to be seen performing at theatres and as Gidayu singers,
               they have not as yet appeared in the story-teller's hall.

            <div data-el="p">
               Story-telling as a profession is of comparatively
               recent origin, though the art itself has been appreciated
               and cultivated from the oldest times. The Emperor Toba
               (twelfth century) used to order his courtiers to tell him
               stories of love, war, and adventure, and there is every
               evidence to show that these men occupied positions in the
               court similar to that of the jester of the courts of
               mediaeval Europe.

               The Japanese news narrators of the present time are
               among the most popular men of the cities in which they ply
               their strange vocation. These verbal war bulletins and vocal
               dispensers of information upon the great conflict now waging
               between Japan and Russia serve the masses after the fashion
               of the American newspaper “extras,” and the smaller the
               community where they hold forth the greater is the
               importance of the professional purveyor of war intelligence
               and picturesque narrative.
