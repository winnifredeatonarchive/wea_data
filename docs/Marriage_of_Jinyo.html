            <div data-el="p">Ishida Jinyo returned to Japan at the command of his
               father and the solicitation of his mother. Six years'
               residence in the most modern city in the world had convinced
               the young man that it would be fatal and impossible for him
               to submit to rules and duties which, to his now enlightened
               mind, appeared medieval.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Men of the modern lands married for love, he told himself
               fervently. He did not love this girl whom they had chosen
               for him, and whom he had never even seen. He loved one of
               the fair daughters of this wonderful land of his adoption.
               To his supreme joy, she had but recently expressed her
               willingness to become the Lady Ishida Jinyo. In a condition
               of youthful ecstasy, he hastened to announce the fact to his
               honorable parents. Hardly had he dispatched the letter,
               however, when he was seized with a sense of uneasiness.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Whatever his apprehensions as to the effect of the
               announcement upon his parents, he was hardly prepared for
               the sharp and drastic summons of his father to return to
               Japan at once. Something in the curt tone of the letter
               brought before him a memory of his father's unsmiling,
               impassive face. How quickly had he once rushed to obey the
               slightest word of command of that parent! Even now,
               instinctively, mechanically, he obeyed; but his young soul
               was filled with bitterness and rebellion as he made the
               journey across the waters. He told himself, repeatedly, that
               he was a different being from the one who had left Japan so
               willingly and gone out into the great unknown West. His eyes
               had been opened to new wonders and truths. He had drunk of
               an intoxicating fount! There had been much written and said
               of the lure of the East; but the spell of the West was
               stronger, utterly irresistible. Not alone his clothes had
               changed, but his very mode of thought! He had learned to
               love! It would be impossible to resume the life of his
               boyhood, which seemed to him now like a dream.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With these thoughts in mind, he was unprepared for the
               effect upon him of the first sight of his home. As the rosy-
               tinted form of the white-robed Fuji-yama traced its pure
               outline against the sky, Jinyo was conscious of an exciting
               throb. Loitering for a few days in Tokyo, the peculiar
               fascination of the homeland seemed to press itself upon him;
               unable to analyze it, he started upon the last stages of his
               journey and arrived at night in his home city, Kyoto. As he
               passed through the familiar streets, he felt like one
               awakening from a strange, long dream, very hard to shake
               off, and impossible to forget.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Threading in and out through the narrow, twisting streets,
               watching the shining bodies of his runners as they drew him
               up and up through the hill country which closes in about
               Kyoto on all sides, Jinyo at last resigned himself to that
               delicious sense of awakening. Presently the runners had
               dropped the poles of the vehicle, and he bad alighted before
               his father's house. His emotions strangled him. He could not
               speak, nor scarcely dared to look at the faces of his
               parents. The flutter of his mother's sleeves as she came
               down the path to meet him awoke in his breast old memories.
               His father's bald head, bowing to the level of Jinyo's
               knees, touched him to the soul. His mother was prostrating!
               He tried to return their deep obeisances, but it was six
               years since he had indulged in such exquisite courtesies.
               His
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="741"/>
               
               back and neck were stiff. He was painfully conscious of his
               American clothes, the derby hat, creased trousers, yellow
               gloves and shoes.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Jinyo put out his hands gropingly:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Mother! Father!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His voice was husky, unsteady. There was a pause. Then,
               her sweet voice trembling slightly, his mother spoke the
               simple words with which the polite Japanese greet each other
               when they meet:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I pray you excuse my rudeness the last time we met.”
               And his father:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It is a long time since I hung upon your honorable eye-
               brows.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               This was his welcome home! There came up vividly before
               the young man a memory of his farewell with his American
               sweetheart and her family. They had kissed him—the mother
               and many sisters of the girl, and finally she herself! He
               blushed hotly at the very memory, and again felt that
               tingling thrill which had weakened and dazzled him then. How
               they had clung to his hands, thrown their arms about his
               neck, wept noisily!
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Now his own parents mechanically bowed to him and murmured
               polite words of greeting. He felt the need, the thirsty
               desire for the warm expressions of that other land.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               As he followed them up the path, something in his mother's
               drooping shoulders moved him. Stooping suddenly, he looked
               into her face wistfully. There was a silvery light from the
               moon, and under its beam for a moment he saw clearly his
               mother's eyes. They were moist! Then he understood. It was
               he who had raised the barrier between them. It was he who
               had changed, who was queer—unnatural. He drew his mother
               back into the shadow of the wisteria grove, and as his
               father passed out of sight, Jinyo took her in his arms and
               kissed her!
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What is—that?” she stammered in a muffled voice, wiping
               with her sleeve her cheek where his lips had touched.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “An expression of—love!” he whispered huskily.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Timidly, she laid her hand upon his arm, as if to restrain
               him, and her touch recalled the many times when, as a boy,
               her little hand had rested there, half chidingly, half
               pleadingly. In the dim light he could see that her eyes were
               shining.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Pray thee excuse the honorable father from the new
               embrace, my son,” she said, and there was a touch of anxiety
               in her voice. “It is”—she thought a moment, and tried to
               smile approvingly—“honorably comfortable, but—er—
               requiring scientific knowledge properly to appreciate.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               At that he laughed, but there was a hysterical sound to
               his laughter. His father, hearing him, turned back. Jinyo,
               upon a sudden impulse, told him what he had done, and the
               comment of his mother. His father looked at him stolidly a
               moment, and then, the samurai calm of his face unbroken, be
               said, brusquely:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The honorable father will endure the West embrace also.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With unblinking eyes, he solemnly lifted his face. Jinyo
               bent quickly and kissed him. Then, his heart feeling
               strangely light, he threw an arm about the shoulder of
               either parent, and three abreast, they went up the path.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In the doorway, above which a single lantern shed a ruddy
               light, a young girl awaited them. As Jinyo saw the little
               bowing figure, all his moodiness and misery returned upon
               him in a flood. His arms slipped, unconsciously, from his
               parents' shoulders. Almost he seemed about to retreat. He
               desired to retrace his steps, to go anywhere, save into his
               father's house, where, upon the very threshold, the one they
               had chosen for him awaited his coming.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The light of the lantern gleamed upon the glittering
               ornaments of her head and showed the two small hands
               submissively placed upon her knees; but it was impossible to
               see the girl's face. Slowly, shyly, she retreated from the
               doorway, bowing at every step. Presently she had vanished
               into the house.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His father's voice was very cool and sturdy:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Daughter of the Saito house of <span title="im- perishable" data-el="choice">
                  
                  imperishable
                  </span> fame! It will be an honor to be allied to so
               august a family.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His mother's voice was timid, and the note of anxiety had
               deepened. Her eyes, too, entreated her son's gaze.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “She is as virtuous as she is beautiful, my son.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He started to speak, but bit back the passionate words.
               Not yet could he find it in him to drive the light from his
               father's face, the hope from his mother's.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p"></div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               They did not even consult him in regard to the
               celebrations in his honor. His father, a man of wealth,
               spared no expense in the matter. Invitations were dispatched
               to even the most remote relatives and connections, and the
               entire Ishida family (one might say clan) gathered in Kyoto
               to celebrate the nuptials of Ishida Jinyo and Saito Ochika.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The very assurance and speed with which his father had
               pressed the preparations for the wedding, swept the young
               man from his feet. There seemed no opportunity, even had he
               found the courage, to declare himself, as, daily, he told
               himself he must do. Passive, filial obedience was what they
               seemed to expect of him. And so, with incredible speed the
               days passed away, and finally there came the ceremony of
               betrothal.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The house and extensive gardens were put into holiday
               dress; thousands of butterflies purchased to illuminate the
               gardens were set free from their cages, while the geisha
               houses contributed of their best talent for the night.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               There was an air of festivity in the entire neighborhood,
               over which the Ishida family dominated by reason of its
               ancestry, power, and wealth.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Ochika was invisible, but it had already become the boast
               of the family that no lovelier bride in all Kyoto had ever
               entered the house of the dread ancestors. Certain it was
               that they would be propitiated, just as the heart of the
               bridegroom must inevitably be won.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Meanwhile, the sliding doors of his chamber securely
               fastened by an imported lock, the distracted bridegroom
               paced the floor. At his father's desire, he was garbed in
               the conventional dress of the Japanese; but the hakama<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> were
               awry, the dress badly fastened; for he had refused
               assistance from man or maid. He was biting his lips so
               cruelly that the blood started to the surface, and one hand,
               deep in the pocket of his sleeve, was clenched about a piece
               of paper. It was a letter that had come to him only that
               day, answering his own desperate summons to her to join him
               at once in Japan.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               From day to day, he had gone along, passively,
               automatically obeying the voice of authority, just as he had
               done when a boy. To all true Japanese he was but doing his
               instinctive duty. Duty! That was the greatest word, so they
               said, in the entire language. It was greater than love, so
               they earnestly averred and believed. But, ah! In America,
               the land to which he believed he truly belonged, love was
               paramount! He felt that his weakness, cowardice, as he named
               it, would vanish were she but to come to him. Her presence
               would strengthen his vacillating will. Now, desperately,
               despairingly, his hand was clenched about the girl's answer
               to his appeal:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “There is only one way in which I can answer you,” she had
               written. “Come to me here, in America, Jinyo. I cannot
               understand the Japanese code of honor. I only know we love
               each other, and that by every natural law and instinct you
               should be at my side. With your family hostile to me, can
               you really ask me to go to you in Japan? I cannot do that.
               It is your place to come to me. I give you the choice of two
               courses. Come to me—or give me up!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It seemed to the agonized young man that two forces were
               dragging him in opposite directions. How ardently had he
               hoped she would understand the situation, and would help
               him! What should he do? What was his duty? Should he obey
               the impulse of desire and hasten to her side with the speed
               of wings?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It was not possible to put behind one the claims not alone
               of a lifetime, but of one's very ancestors. Nor could he
               disgrace the ones who had given him life.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="743"/>
               
               Out in the gardens a geisha's voice shrilled sweetly. She
               was singing an ancient song of honor and supreme sacrifice.
               He opened a shoji<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> and looked out. Everywhere the swinging
               lanterns were hung from eave and lintel, and strung down the
               long bamboo avenue. Like twinkling, fairy lights, the
               fireflies danced in and out among the trees. The buzz of
               murmuring voices, the moving figures of attending
               waitresses, the penetrating odor of the pipes, all the dimly
               familiar symbols of his early youth, dazzled him now. As on
               that first night when he had driven up to his father's house
               through the hills, Jinyo was conscious now of a sense of
               beguilement, almost of hypnotism. It was as if suddenly he
               had found a treasure, long-lost. Why, then, could he not rid
               his heart of this piercing ache?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His mother's voice called to him gently outside the
               screens. All through the evening she had sought to force the
               sliding screens apart, but the unyielding Western lock held
               them firmly closed.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Jinyo!” Her voice was barely above a whisper.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Now she was moistening the paper, scratching a hole in the
               fusuma<a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> (new and costly in his honor). Her lips were at the
               opening.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

               “Mother?”

            <div data-el="p">
               “They toast the honorable moon!”

            <div data-el="p">
               Silence a moment; then, he said gruffly:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “That is well.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “It is necessary,” she pleaded, “that you lend prestige to
               the occasion with your honorable presence.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Silence again, and then he said, less gruffly:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I will come. Go before me, if you please.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Over the gardens the moon rode in lordly splendor. There
               was a clear, star-sprinkled sky, and the air was balmy and
               cool. A dancer, attended by her apprentice and maid, was
               posturing, her body, arms, hands, and head, moving and
               swaying with a curious preciseness in the classical dance.
               There was, to Jinyo, a subtle fascination about her every
               movement. Not the slightest twist or motion of even her
               smallest finger was lost upon him. It was incredible, the
               effect obtained by the mere motion of the body. How the
               little sparkling hands seemed to speak! Was ever a neck or
               wrist more fragile! He found himself marveling at his
               ability to feel so keenly. Why, even the dancing of this
               geisha girl caused him a pang. Was it pleasure or pain—or
               both? he asked himself, and knew that it was because she was
               typical of Japan, the land he had believed he had put far
               behind him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His father's face, benevolent, even smiling now, beamed at
               him from across the circle of guests. A lump rose in his
               throat, and the hand, clenched about the letter, loosened.
               Could he, publicly, turn against the honored parent?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The smiling, friendly gaze of those who wished him well,
               smote his heart. Was it possible to betray their confidence
               in him?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Why, these honorable guests who drank to his health and
               wished him ten thousand years of joy, were of his own blood,
               his kindred, his family! They were of one seed with him. The
               family honor, the ancestors' honor, this was what they had
               gathered together to celebrate!
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His father was speaking, the relatives giving respectful
               attention to every word. Modestly, yet with a certain
               dignified pride, the head of the family sketched the
               honorable history of the illustrious ancestors.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “There is no seed to a great man!” The father of Jinyo
               quoted the ancient proverb reverently. At the same time, he
               pointed out that while none could inherit greatness, it
               behooved the descendants to honor the exalted ones by
               striving to imitate their virtues and talents. It was
               impossible to turn a deaf ear to the voices of the departed
               ones, who demanded that their race be honorably sustained.
               It was the supreme duty of the descendants to make the
               offerings and keep the race alive! Marriage was a sacred
               duty, not a matter of desire. Modern times had not,
               fortunately, effaced from the Japanese conscience the
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="744"/>
               
               supreme ideal of duty. His son, Jinyo, represented an
               honorable example of this, for after six years' residence in
               foreign lands, he had returned to Japan—to do his duty! The
               West lands might alter his clothes, his food, his point of
               view even, but they could not change—his heart! That,
               happily, would remain, through all time, pure Japanese!
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               In the pause that ensued, the relatives refilled their
               pipes and swallowed countless thimblefuls of saké. They
               smiled significantly at one another, and whispered
               cheerfully among themselves. All knew of Jinyo's American
               predilections, and of his expressed desire to marry a
               daughter of that land; but one and all were confident that
               his wavering was but transient. Strange drinks intoxicate.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Now, pipes suspended, bowls inverted, attentively they
               awaited the speech of the bridegroom; for, suddenly, he had
               arisen unsteadily to his feet. Even in the shadowy light of
               the gardens, his eyes glittered strangely, and the pallor of
               his face was marked. His voice was hoarse. He seemed to be
               laboring under some intense excitement, no longer possible
               of repression.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The frog in the pond knows not the great ocean,” said the
               young man, “and, knowing it not, is happy in its pool.
               Transported to the great sea's bosom, the hapless one,
               intoxicated by its vastness, must in the end become
               engulfed. So it is with the youth sent out into strange
               lands. Alas! the vast waters suck them into their heart, and
               it is not possible ever again completely to escape. The fate
               of the honorable frog has been that of the humble member of
               the honorable house of Ishida. He has tried, vainly, to dam
               up the ocean with his hand—but his hand is small, and 'the
               ocean ignores the dust.'”

            <div data-el="p">
               He stopped, conscious of the effect of his words. The
               silence of the family was more eloquent than a torrent of
               noises. The unaccustomed saké rose to Jinyo's head, which
               seemed to swim in vertigo. He tried to speak further, but
               his tongue refused. Suffering intensely, aware of the
               disgrace of his visible emotion, a sob rose in his throat.
               Suddenly, he became conscious that some one very close to
               him had whispered his name.

               It might have been his mother's voice, so gentle, so
               coaxing, so wistful its tone. Like one in a dream, slowly he
               turned, and, for the first time, he beheld the face of his
               bride.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She was as pale as he, but in her long, dark eyes was a
               calm as soothing and sweet as a summer sea. The eyes of a
               Japanese woman are a veiled mystery, into which a man may
               not look, until his marriage day. The girl beside him had
               lifted the veil, and Jinyo saw! Such a sense of light
               flooded the being of the tempest-tossed Jinyo, he felt
               enervated, weakened. Reaching out his hand blindly, he felt
               it enclosed by hers, warm, pressing, comforting beyond
               expression.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His eyes wandered vaguely across the circle—embraced the
               surrounding scenery, lingered on the moving maids, the
               geishas tuning their instruments, and suddenly he ceased to
               struggle. His home—his own land had drawn him back! It
               alone was real, and all else that had come between was as a
               dim dream, soon to be blotted out. Looking at that precious
               circle of faces, he knew, with a glad, triumphant thrill,
               that he was part of it. In the eyes of the one, whose little
               hand rested confidently within his own, he had found the
               most precious treasure of life—peace!

               late. With repressed smiles, low chuckles, whispered
               assurances and, perhaps, a few tears, they were departing.

            <div data-el="p">
               Something crinkled in the sleeve of Ishida Jinyo. Half-
               absently he drew it out. For a moment he looked at it,
               almost curiously. Then, still abstractedly, he began to roll
               it into a little ball. As, suddenly, he snapped it with his
               fingers, so that it bounced into the air and disappeared,
               the girl beside him broke into low, silvery laughter, and
               Jinyo, looking into her deep eyes again, laughed with her.
