            </h2>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">Mr. Albemarle Haug struck an attitude, his feet wide
               apart, his monocle fixed in his left eye. He twirled his
               small, incipient mustache with one hand and his cane with
               the other. He cleared his throat with a prolonged “Ahem!,”
               looked knowing, and then said, “Ohayo!” with an unmistakable
               accent.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “A-a-goo-mornin',” she returned, with the slightest
               inclination of her small, disdainful head.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Beautiful mawning!” continued Mr. Albemarle Haug.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Honorably beautiful,” she agreed.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Sun shining, you know, like—ah—you!” He put the end of
               his cane into his mouth, and watched for the effect of his
               compliment.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               It was wasted on her. She merely said, in a queer little
               subtle undertone, “You arisin' early with thad honorable
               sun?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The air, you know—” he began to explain.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah, yaes, the honorable air augustly beneficial to
               sniff.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “To what? Oh, yes, by Jove!” and he laughed constrainedly.
               “That's a good one!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She agreed with him, in a dignified fashion, that the
               honorable air was a good one, particularly so in this part
               of her insignificant country. Then she inquired as to
               whether his honorable nose was benefited by the honorable
               air.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Her question ruffled the pride of Mr. Albemarle Haug, and
               then, thinking better of it, he broke into noisy laughter.
               He told her that his nose had nothing to do with his
               presence there; it was in a perfectly healthy and admirable
               condition.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Being on the subject of health, however, she gracefully
               pursued it.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Your honorable health is good?” she inquired, with
               extravagant solicitude.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Fine!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Also, those healths of your honorable mother an' sister?”
               this last with affected anxiety.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “They're all right. Now, look here, Miss—er—Perfume,
               we'll talk of you, don't you know.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She turned her shoulder and looked at him over it. “I too
               augustly insignificant to converse about.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mr. Albemarle Haug threw convention to the winds. “You—
               you little bit of Dresden—”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She backed from him as he approached her. Suddenly she
               halted, and stiffly faced him. She struck his outstretched
               hand down smartly with her fan. “Whad you honorably
               attempt?” she demanded.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “To kiss you,” he said, “just with my fingers.” He
               attempted to pinch her cheek, but again she stepped back
               quickly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You altogedder too kind,” she said; and Mr. Albemarle
               Haug could not get it through his head just whether she
               meant this gratefully or satirically.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               His hesitation lasted but a moment, and his ardor
               increased with the delay. He attempted to put his arm round
               her, but the act received a prompt and sharp punishment.
               Perfume suddenly opened her little purple parasol. It
               reached just about to the Englishman's chin. She elevated it
               viciously to the level of his nose. A few moments later Mr.
               Albemarle Haug's immaculate appearance had undergone a
               remarkable change. His hat
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="80"/>
               
               had disappeared from his head and had gone on an independent
               chase before a sharp little wind, which bore it toward the
               bay; his glass had tumbled from his eye and was dangling
               over his polka-dotted waistcoat; his tie had ascended above
               his high collar, while across his honorable nose a long red
               scratch added to his appearance of bewilderment and chagrin,
               and gave the young gentleman a ridiculous aspect. A few
               yards away from him, Miss Perfume had closed her parasol,
               and was regarding him with triumphant defiance.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               For his further mortification, a third party arrived on
               the scene to witness his humiliation.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Hello, Haug! What's up?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The dooce!” said Mr. Albemarle Haug.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Bob Graves grinned approvingly. Miss Perfume unfurled her
               fan and placed it before her face just above her delightful
               little nose. Her eyes twinkled with merriment above the fan.
               Bob took in the situation at a glance.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Too bad, old man,” he said, soothingly; and then added,
               as his eye met the defiant glance of the girl, “Serves you
               right, though.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mr. Albemarle Haug had by this time regained something of
               his normal poise. He was regarding Perfume with a look of
               mingled reproach and admiration. “You were reahlly hard on a
               fellow,” he drawled.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Aexcuse me,” returned Miss Perfume. “Ah bah!” (Good-bye.)
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What! You're not going already?” said Mr. Albemarle Haug;
               and he watched her in amazement as she went down the hill
               and across the rice-fields toward her home.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Who is she, Haug?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Who? Why, a Jap girl, of course,” returned Mr. Albemarle
               Haug, irritably, replacing his monocle and looking about
               wistfully for his hat and cane.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “She made pretty strong objections to you, apparently,”
               said Bob, looking with critical amusement at the other's
               disfigured nose. “I thought you were something of a lady-
               killer, old man.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I tell you it was an accident—just a bluff the little
               witch made. She saw you coming, I fawncy.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah, so?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mr. Albemarle Haug's attitude again grew uncertain. “Look
               here, old chap, you'll not let this story get out among the
               fellows, will you? It reahlly was nothing but an absurd
               accident, though I appreciate how doocid queer it would
               sound, and I'm not in temper for a chaffing over there.” He
               waved his stick toward the hotel, and added, with
               unconcealed disgust: “A Japanese girl! It would reahlly, you
               know, sound ridiculous.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It would,” said Bob, enjoying himself immensely.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You won't disgrace me, will you, old fellow?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I won't disgrace her,” said Bob, grinning expansively.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Her! Why look here, she's just one of those little dolls
               you see everywhere here.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well, she had spirit to resist you, Haug.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Fudge!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “And she was adorably pretty.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah, thanks awfully.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You see, I contemplate matrimony with this young person.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You do!” Bob's sense of the ridiculous began to desert
               him. “How did you get acquainted with her?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Mashed her,” said Mr. Albemarle Haug, nonchalantly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, come now, Haug, she isn't that kind.” There was a
               tone of resentment in the voice.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mr. Albemarle Haug frowned uncomfortably. “Why, old chap,
               they're all alike—can have any of them if you whistle for
               them.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Not all of them.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well, the exceptions don't abound round here. She's not
               one of them, I fawncy. She lives over there, see, in that
               little house. Her people are day-laborers in the rice-
               fields.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “How did you come across her?” Bob was quite serious now.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="81"/>
               
               “Mother and Adelaide picked her up somewhere, and when I
               came back here they tried to hide her from me. Couldn't fool
               this old boy!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Then you met her through your people? She's a friend of
               your mother's?”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Friend! Reahlly, Graves, you are very funny. Mother and

            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, indeed! Why?”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Tell you the truth, Graves—I—” He tapped his chest
               significantly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I see,” said Bob, with brief curtness.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I will marry her inspite of them,” went on Mr. Albemarle
               Haug, fatuously. “Easiest thing in the world, you know—cup
               of tea, song, fee and the rest.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You mean, then—?”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Exactly.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Graves shrugged his shoulders, skeptically. “Well, if I'm
               not very much mistaken, you won't get that girl.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, fudge!” said Mr. Albemarle Haug, with airy
               confidence.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p"></div>
            
            <div data-el="p">Mrs. Haug had in mind, when she brought her two children
               to Japan, a fixed purpose other than the usual one of the
               sojourning tourist. The dearest ambition of her life was to
               secure a position for her son in the diplomatic service. She
               had exhausted all that effort, money, and influence could do
               in England, and had finally been recommended to come to
               Japan and attack in person the Honorable Clarence Marchmont,
               in whose power it lay to bestow on her son the desired
               position. She had a very long letter of introduction to Mr.
               Marchmont and her own wit and craft to assist her.
               Unfortunately, Mr. Marchmont, at the time of their arrival
               in Japan, was in Hong Kong with his wife, while his
               daughter, an only child, was said to be in delicate health
               and unable to receive visitors. Otherwise Mrs. Haug would
               have made it a point cultivate the girl's acquaintance in
               the absence of her father.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Nothing daunted, however, by the absence of Mr. Marchmont,
               Mrs. Haug had come from Tokyo to this fashionable little
               watering-place, and here she waited and recuperated against
               his return.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               There was also another reason responsible for her presence
               in Japan. She was extremely anxious to patch up a broken
               engagement between her daughter Adelaide and Robert Graves.
               At the time of its existence, Mrs. Haug had refused to
               recognize it, for Bob had then nothing beyond his frank and
               attractive young manhood to offer Miss Haug. The mother had
               kept up such a persistent and relentless nagging at the girl
               that Adelaide, who was a revised edition of herself, with a
               strain of her brother's sentimentality to temper her
               constant haughtiness, had succumbed. On his dismissal, Bob
               had gone out to Japan. Hardly six months later, the Haugs
               learned of his inheritance of a large estate and fortune.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Now Mrs. Haug was very much discouraged and unhappy.
               Besides the fact that her plans regarding Adelaide seemed
               futile, in view of the exasperating attitude of indifference
               with which Bob met their advances, Albemarle had given her
               hysterical cause for alarm by this absurd infatuation for
               this Japanese girl. Mrs. Haug bitterly bewailed the fate
               that had thrown the girl across their path. In the beginning
               she had thanked providence for her timely arrival. Perfume
               had come to her assistance one afternoon in the woods, when
               her runners had deserted both Adelaide and herself because
               she had refused to pay more than the customary fee. Perfume
               had gracefully offered them her jinrikisha<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>. The Haugs had
               offered to pay her, but she had refused to accept the money.
               Under the impulse of her momentary gratitude, Mrs. Haug had
               patronizingly invited the girl to call on them at their
               hotel. Perfume came, and trouble followed. Albemarle saw her
               and fell in love with her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               A few days after Mr. Albemarle Haug's unfortunate
               encounter, Bob Graves had the good fortune again to
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="82"/>
               
               come across Miss Perfume. He had lately acquired a habit of
               strolling across the fields in the direction in which her
               home lay.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She was sitting on the beach, a large book spread out
               before her. She returned his greeting with distant
               haughtiness. He sat down on the sands beside her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I am not responsible,” said he, “for the rudeness of
               others. Please do not punish me.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The hard little look in her eyes grew uncertain.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Besides,” he continued, seeing his advantage, “you know
               that, at best, we are merely barbarians, and you should make
               allowance for us.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               As he spoke to her, his eyes traveled admiringly over her
               face. The sun shone on her hair, and he was startled at its
               ruddy glow. Hitherto he had never seen a Japanese girl whose
               hair was not a dense black. Perfume's was distinctly bronze
               red, and there was the faintest ripple in it. Moreover, just
               above the nape of her little white neck and about her ears
               and temples, the short ends that escaped curled
               entrancingly. Her eyes, too, though long and narrow, were
               quite large, and when she opened them wide he saw that they
               were almost yellow. Her unique beauty puzzled him, but a
               subtle charm pervaded his senses and made analysis of her
               attraction for him impossible.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               From distant haughtiness the expression of her face
               gradually relented into an arch friendliness that was
               bewitching. All she said, however, was:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “English gendleman honorably perlite to honorably

            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I tried to put in all the good words I could for you with
               the Haugs,” Bob continued.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Why?” demanded Perfume, suddenly defiant.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Bob blundered. “Why, well, I thought—you see—I thought
               it just possible that you and—”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The friendliness disappeared from her face in an instant.
               “Tha's nod bisiness for you,” she said, icily.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After this cutting reproof Bob sat in uncomfortable
               silence. Several times she peeped at him sidewise under her
               long lashes. Then she again relented, and began to confide
               in him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Thad Mr. Albemarle Haug make marry at me,” she said.

            <div data-el="p">
               “You don't say!” cried Bob, sitting up, indignantly.

            <div data-el="p">
               She nodded solemnly.

            <div data-el="p">
               “The impudence of the fellow!” he exclaimed, and caught
               her eye, whereat they both laughed, and became fast friends
               from that moment.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “When is it to be?” he inquired.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Whad?” she asked, innocently.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Your marriage.”

               “I dunno egsact date,” she returned.

            <div data-el="p">
               He was really alarmed now. He sat bolt upright. “Then you

            <div data-el="p">

               “Where did you learn to speak English?” he asked her next.

               must have lived among us?”

            <div data-el="p"> A few weeks later an embarrassing interview took place
               between Mrs. Haug and Miss Perfume. The former lady, in
               company with her daughter Adelaide, went to the little house
               where the Japanese girl lived, and called on her. Perfume
               received them with ceremonious politeness, pressing on them
               the hospitality of what she termed her “honorably
               insignificant hovel of a house.”

            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Haug went straight to the purpose of her visit.

            <div data-el="p">
               “No, we don't care to eat,” she said, closing her lips
               grimly, and shuddering disgustedly at the little Japanese
               lunch brought in by a maid. “I am very sorry to have to tell
               you that we have come on a most painful and disagreeable
               mission.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Tha's vaery sad,” said Perfume, sympathetically. “Mebbe I

            <div data-el="p">
               Perfume inclined her head gracefully. “He mos' vaery
               perlite foreign gendlemans,” she complimented. “Pray, you
               come see me for you' son?”

            <div data-el="p">
               Perfume smiled sweetly. “Mebbe,” said she, “you come unto
               me to entreat me to mek honorable marriage with you' august
               son? Mebbe?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I did not come for that purpose,” said Mrs. Haug,
               indignantly.

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               “I came to say,” announced Mrs. Haug, with asperity, “that

            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Impossible!” Perfume was puzzled. Had she not herself by
               her answer rendered it impossible? Why, then, had this
               stupid Englishwoman come to tell her it was impossible?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes, quite impossible. In the first place, my son is an
               English gentleman, and could not marry a Japanese girl. He
               has important business to attend to here, and he must not be
               inveigled into a marriage that would wreck his career.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Perfume's face, passing from serene and polite
               friendliness to shocked amazement, had gradually become
               stonily inscrutable as the other woman spoke. When Mrs. Haug
               had finished, the young girl, without deigning to address
               one word in response, clapped her hands loudly. Instantly a
               maid answered the summons.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Show these barbarian visitors to their jinrikishas,” she
               said, and then, with a deep bow of mock obeisance, she left
               her infuriated guests.

               It had been quite an exciting day for the Haugs. They had
               obtained tickets for the legation tent, and had put in a
               pleasurable and profitable day with the many foreign
               diplomats and their families and friends. To add to their
               triumph, they had met the Honorable Mr. Marchmont; had
               unceremoniously and gushingly handed him the letter of
               introduction, and he had cordially and informally invited
               them to attend a large ball he was giving that evening at
               the Hotel Imperial, in honor of the Mikado's birthday, and
               to celebrate his daughter's début into society.

               The ball was a most imposing and luxurious affair. The
               Haugs arrived during the crush. As they passed through the
               brilliantly lighted vestibule into the corridor and took
               their places in the procession making its way toward the
               little receiving line, they could catch bits of the gossip
               and chatter that floated about them.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               One American woman was telling her tall escort, in a high
               nasal voice loud enough to be heard by all about her, that
               she had known the Marchmonts for a very long time. The
               daughter had been born and educated in Japan—quite an odd
               fancy of the father, who was just a little freaky, though so
               dear, as everyone knew. The girl was altogether too young to
               “come out” yet, but it was a charming little accident that
               was making them hasten it. She was to have been “finished”
               in Europe and America first; but she had fallen in love with
               someone, and her father, who doted on her, had actually
               consented to her early marriage. He really was such an
               impossible man, was dear Mr. Marchmont. His own life and
               marriage had been so deliciously romantic and eccentric! He
               had married a Japanese lady in European fashion, had taken
               her abroad with him, and was so proud of her and their
               daughter!

            <div data-el="p">
               “Mother,” said Adelaide, “don't you think it was shocking
               of Mr. Marchmont to marry a Japanese lady?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Certainly not,” said Mrs. Haug, adjusting her pince-nez.
               “It is the secret of his popularity, I understand. His wife
               is said to be perfectly charming. I consider it an honor to
               meet her.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “You objected to my marrying a Japanese girl,” said
               Albemarle, bitterly.

            <div data-el="p">
               “That was altogether different,” said Mrs. Haug. “Mr.
               Marchmont married a lady of rank and fortune, related to one
               of the noblest families in Japan, her own father being a
               count, I am told.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well,” said Albemarle, doggedly, “there's no difference.
               Perfume would put any girl I ever saw out of sight.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “A little, insignificant piece of bric-a-brac,” said
               Adelaide, scornfully, and Mrs. Haug added, witheringly:

            <div data-el="p">
               “I have no patience with you, Albemarle.”

            <div data-el="p">
               Meanwhile they were slowly advancing along the line.

            <div data-el="p">
               “I can see them quite plainly now,” whispered Mrs. Haug.
               “That must be dear Mrs. Marchmont, the lady in white satin
               and pearls.” She lowered her voice. “I am amazed, Adelaide,”
               she said, “at the gorgeousness of this Mrs. Marchmont.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Are you sure my hair's all right?” questioned Adelaide.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes, dear. Adelaide, do you think I could possibly wear

               “Well,” said Mrs. Haug, plaintively, “she cannot possibly

               “What nonsense, mother! You can't see her from here.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Adelaide, notice the hang of that little gown. If it
               wasn't so plain and simple I would say that it came from
               Worth's.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

               “The dear child!” Mrs. Haug's voice rose in sympathy to
               the shrill note of the American woman in front of them. “I
               had heard of her sweet beauty. Now I see—“

               They had almost reached the receiving party by this time.
               Adelaide saw her mother stop suddenly; the busy, important
               form became rigid.

            <div data-el="p">
               “What's the matter, mother? Why don't you go on?”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Adelaide,” said Mrs. Haug, in a

               voice that was so peculiarly thin and parched as to be
               barely recognizable, “there is something wrong with my
               eyes.”

            <div data-el="p">

               “Go in front of me, Adelaide. Now look at the girl—this

            <div data-el="p">
               For once in her life Miss Haug's composure completely
               failed her. “Oh, my goodness!” she ejaculated.

            <div data-el="p">
               “What's the matter with you two?” growled Albemarle,
               sticking his head forward. “Making shows of yourselves!”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Look!” said Adelaide, faintly.

            <div data-el="p">
               Mr. Albemarle Haug fixed his monocle securely, and stared
               hard.

               The American woman's voice in front of them, maddeningly
               clear, could be plainly heard in the little hush that
               ensued. “Do look at her, the dear child! Eyes for no one but

               Mrs. Haug touched the speaker's arm with agitation she
               could not repress. “For whom?” she queried, faintly.

               “Why, her fiancé, of course,” returned the American woman,
