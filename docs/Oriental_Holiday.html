            <div data-el="p">What Christmas is to the Westerners, New Year's is to the Japanese, although congratulations
               and greetings
               are not merely confined to the first day of the New Year, but at any time between
               the first and fifteenth. This
               is the time of universal peace and good will in Japan; when the inhabitants of the
               little Empire prepare to start
               life anew, with all bad feelings done away with and fine promises and resolutions
               for the future. In fact, the
               first of January bears the significant title of <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Gan-san</span> (the Three Beginnings), meaning
               the beginning of the year, the beginning of the month and the beginning of the day.
               One might be tempted to add
               to this "The beginning of a new life," for so realistically and conscientiously do
               the Japanese try to observe
               the almost national rule of striving earnestly to make themselves better at this time
               that it becomes an almost
               literal belief with them that they have succeeded. That is a pretty truth, I think—that
               a good belief
               generally tends to make the good reality.

               the whole year round,
               and all things in nature bear the same aspect, yet it all seems different. It is the
               spirit of the New Year.
               Then, too, the busy workers, who have been preparing nearly a month ahead for this
               season, have laid aside the
               bamboo duster and broom, and a general quiet and happiness seems to reign over the
               Land of Sunrise. The first of
               January is the only day in the year on which all stores are closed, as the merchants
               do not recognize the Sabbath
               or other holidays. This day is a universal holiday, and many, many happy families
               rise very early in the morning
               to worship the first rising sun of the New Year.

               faces of the little
               people beam with earnestness and light heartedness; the very birds seem to be trilling
               in a tender tone, and the
               exquisite wild plum blossom (the <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">nume</span>) breathes its perfume and loveliness over all,
               while the soft strains of the beautiful national hymn might be heard from a thousand
               homes, mingled with the
               accompaniment of the <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">koto</span> 
               <a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> and the <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">samisen</span>. <a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> On this day all the members of a family congratulate
               each other the first thing in the morning and then sit at tables, each one having
               a little one to themselves, the
               table being perhaps not over half a foot high. Spiced cake is then passed around,
               symbolic of the wish that each
               one may drink a cup of immortality, then soup follows, and they all wish the others
               ten thousand years of
               joy.

               Japanese venerate both of
               these, because they keep green through the entire winter, and are symbols of longevity.
               The Japanese begin to
               prepare for New Year's about the middle of December. Even the very poorest people
               give their little houses a
               thorough re-cleaning, laying new mats of rice straw and cleaning every nook and corner
               with fresh bamboo dusters,
               symbolizing prosperity and good fortune. On the second of January the streets are
               brilliantly illuminated with
               lanterns, and hung with the national flag and streamers of bunting, and the shrill
               calls of processions of
               venders are heard everywhere.

               "Treasure Ship! Treasure Ship! Treasure Ship!" There they come, walking slowly at
               the back of their richly laden
               carts, drawn by oxen decorated with flags and cloths of every color, and behind them
               and all along the way beside
               them follow a surging crowd of happy children and holiday seekers. Now some vender
               pauses a moment to exchange a
               word with a <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">jinriki</span>-man <a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> and the crowd pauses also. Once in
               a while some little bit of humanity, in the shape of a very small boy, gets mixed
               up in the crowd and loses his
               bearings. A little tear-stained, desolate face peers at you out of the crowd. Soon
               some one has lifted him high on
               their shoulders, crying aloud: "Who owns this august baby?" Then, perhaps, the kind-hearted
               treasure vender slips
               into his little hand some tawdry, bright toy and the little dirty, tearful, grimy
               face becomes suddenly restored
               to its wonted serenity and happiness, as he is restored to his parents. Ah! But the
               good will of the New Year's
               has touched even the rough heart of the weariest peddler and vender.

               boy to Christmas. This same feeling of expectancy and joy at the prospect is very
               contagious in Japan, and almost
               as soon as the month of December sets in, the grown-people as well as the children
               begin to talk about it, many
               of them even beginning preparations that early. Especially are the young girls interested
               in it, and often one
               comes across gay, laughing groups, some of them busy sewing or fashioning odd toys
               and presents, others planning
               what they propose to do or buy, and again others whispering together and trying to
               make their companions believe
               that they propose doing something very remarkable and mysterious at that time.

               and patterns. They are
               indefatigable workers at this time, these little women, sewing and embroidering from
               morning till night, and are
               as much interested in a new gown as the most stylish Parisian lady that ever stepped.
               In fact, when the New
               Year's finally sets in, there is always some one who has broken down from overwork.
               Perhaps she is an older sister
               who has had to make not only her own but her sister's gowns.

               the meaning of the New Year's, so children, large and small, try their little best
               to be unusually good, docile,
               and obedient during this season. Though they play happy games throughout the entire
               day, yet they will endeavor
               to be as gentle and obedient as possible. Looking at a group of Japanese children
               sometime during the New Year's
               season, a Westerner is struck more than ever by the innate gentleness and refinement

               of the people, which is shown even among the most boisterous of children. It is at
               this season, too, that the
               youngsters strive to show the best specimens of their penmanship, and try to outdo
               each other in obedience and
               goodness at this time.

               but with the dawn of Western
               ideas, Japan retaining all her orientalness, gave up a great deal of what the reformists
               termed "useless expense
               and display." Yet the beautiful parades of Old Japan were said to be as innocent as
               they were conducive of
               merriment and good feeling, absurd though some of them might have seemed to foreigners,
               just as all masquerades

               quiet, unobtrusive way in
               which the Japanese take their pleasure. There is no noisy rioting, no boisterous games,
               no drunken revelers or
               screaming children. In fact, the sounds of merriment are so musical that one would
               miss the sibilant laughter and
               the happy chatter, which seems to accord with the beauty and sunshine everywhere.
               How lovable they are to each
               other at this season; not in the Western fashion truly, of smothering each other with
               kisses, but in a gentle,
               quiet way. Many a doorway is framed with three or four sweet little maids, their arms
               entwined about each other,
               watching the flying <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">jinrikishas</span>, the antics of some clown or juggler, the processions,
               or the younger children at their games. Sometimes quite big girls will join in these
               games and seem to enjoy them
               as much as the children.

            <div data-el="p">	A word about the foreigners in Japan at this season. It must not be thought for a
               moment that in the
               enjoyment of this happy time the Japanese forget the strangers on their soil. Any
               American who has visited Japan
               at this time would tell you of the pains taken to show them every courtesy and make
               them feel perfectly at home
               and welcome by all. The better class and wealthier Japanese often make a point of
               including the foreigners in
               their round of visits, and many a happy foreigner will bring back to his own country
               beautiful and rare gifts
               from generous and kindly disposed Japanese. But the most touching gifts they usually
               receive are those given them
               by their servants or coolies, who are very poor. They take great pride at this time
               in making odd, unexpected
               little gifts to their Americazan (American) or Egurisu (English) masters and mistresses,
               assuring them at the
               same time that "they are a thousand thanks to them until before they die," because
               of the kindness and good
               treatment they have received in the past from their foreign friends. And they bestow
               their gifts without any
               thought of return.

            <h2>An Incident</h2>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">	I know of one especial incident that struck me at the time I heard of it as being
               so touching, yet pretty,
               that I think I will tell you of it. One little Japanese girl spent all her little
               savings, which consisted of a
               little over seven <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">yen</span> (silver dollars) in buying a present for an American lady who at
               one time had befriended her. She walked a distance of over fifteen miles in the early
               morning, in order to reach
               the home of the lady before the noon hour set in, because she had no money left wherewith
               to hire a conveyance.
               The tea house where she was employed was situated on the highway between Tokyo and
               Kyoto, and the American lady
               lived in Tokyo. When she finally reached her destination, she sank down on the little
               step in front of the house,
               leaning against the wall, and slipping her shoes, or sandals, from her feet.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Why, Natsu-san, is that you?" The American lady was standing by her. The girl raised
               a bright, beaming face
               to hers and displayed her gift joyously.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Tha's account I lig' you," she said simply, in pretty broken English.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The American lady's sweet blue eyes were misty. She knew how little the girl could
               afford to bring such a
               gift to her. It was an exquisite silk <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">obi</span> (sash) about fourteen feet long and fourteen
               inches wide, besides being doubled, and made of the finest material.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Tha's account this New Year, an' I thing' that I mek' you present, because you bin'
               mos' vaery kin' to
               me."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Why, Natsu-san, what did you bring me this for?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The American lady had even forgotten wherein she had been kind to the girl. I believe
               it was that she had at
               one time saved the girl from being whipped by an unscrupulous master, and had obtained
               her a good position, her
               husband having some influence in Tokyo. Perhaps the sweetest characteristic of the
               Japanese is their innate
               gratitude for the smallest act of kindness displayed to them.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"It was awfully sweet of you Natsu-san."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The girl made a graceful gesture of dissent.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I nod vaery sweed," she said, "I thing' pretty Americazan lady vaery sweed."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	So the general good spirit and feeling spreads to the foreigners as well as the Japanese
               themselves, and as
               one surveys the happy, contented faces of this little people, they shudder at the
               terrible old missionary adage
               that "man is vile." Ah, not in Japan!
            </div>

            <h2>A Characteristic Trait</h2>
            
            	           
            <div data-el="p">The deferential, almost slave-like, courtesy of Japanese women is at once apparent
               to all who visit that
               beautiful country. It is a little difficult, at first, to become accustomed to their
               obsequiousness, as it is to
               reconcile their doll-like beauty with other standards; and the Westerner will hardly
               appreciate the feelings of
               the Japanese student, who, after having visited America, thanked God that his wife
               and mother were Japanese
               women.
            </div>
            	           
            <div data-el="p">Yet these dainty little creatures have much in their favor. True, they lack the brilliancy
               and cleverness of
               their European sisters, but they possess one trait which has made it possible for
               them to exercise a marked
               influence upon the destiny of their nation—obedience. If they wield any power, it
               is the power of trustful
               silence. With such women, is it any wonder that Japan has taken her place in the front
               rank of European
               nations?
