         <h1>"A Poor Devil"</h1>
         
         By Winnie Eaton, Montreal.
         
         <div data-el="note">[Written for the Metropolitan.]</div>
         
         
         <div data-el="div">
            
            <div data-el="p">Since I was first able to think I have had intense longings for wealth. To have money,
               to have honor, greatness, grandeur and splendour; to have this, was to live. Money,
               to me, was everything. As no man ever longed before, as no one ever could long, I
               longed for wealth. Oh! To be able to put one’s hand in the pocket and feel the roll
               of bank-notes, the clink of gold and silver, to be able to sit at a desk and write
               off a cheque for whatever amount I desired—to have wealth, to have wealth, I prayed
               God to grant it to me.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">I was a law clerk. When I say “law clerk,” please do not suppose I mean a “law student.”
               The student in a law office studies his profession and eventually becomes a lawyer;
               but the law clerk, stay, I am going to define to you what a law clerk is. He is the
               poor devil in the office who is bullied by the partners, patronized by the students,
               pitied by the typewriter and envied by the office boy. He it is who looks after everything
               that comes in and goes out of the office, who does the book-keeping, assists the typewriter,
               goes messages, and after giving ten years of his precious life to one firm actually
               receives the magnificent sum of $10 per week!
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">I had only one relative in the world—my mother. She lived in the country, and I had
               not seen her since I was a boy of fourteen, when I came to the city to earn my living.
               Nevertheless, I had to suppo<span data-el="supplied" data-cert="high" data-resp="pers:SL" title="Certainty: high.Supplied by: pers:SL.">rt her</span>, and out of my $<span data-el="gap" data-reason="damage" title="Reason: damage."></span></div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="gap" data-reason="damage" title="Reason: damage."></span>impossible to one who looks at <span data-el="supplied" data-cert="low" data-resp="pers:SL" title="Certainty: low.Supplied by: pers:SL.">the world</span> as I did. Fools! I loved, I loved, I loved. With all my heart, with all my strength,
               with all my soul, I loved a woman—a woman who seemed as far above me as my God, the
               God I did and did not believe in, the God I said I did not believe in, and yet to
               whom I prayed to for help and forgiveness—my only friend.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">Stern men, who condemn me now, who know not what my past had been, of my trials, my
               poverty, my longings, pause and wonder not that I committed crime.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">To others I appeared quiet, reserved, reticent. The student in the office getting
               up a party to go snowshoeing, skating, or on some other amusement, refrained from
               asking Blake to go, “because he does not care for such things, you know,” not out
               of unkindliness, for I firmly believe that they all, more or less, liked me. For was
               not Blake the one that could be blamed for everything, who never interfered, never
               quarrelled, never tattled. I was quiet, and they thought me absent-minded. Was I absent-minded?
               Never! Why, nothing escaped me. Did I not observe, reflect on everything? Every person
               I met I thought of. Every word they uttered I caught up and dissected. Yes, I understood
               them thoroughly, and I despised them. They were all the same, dull or clever, good
               or bad, they had one thought—self.
            </div> 
            
            
            <div data-el="p">How <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> I hated him for his wealth, <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damage" title="Reason: damage."></span>ess, his good breeding, his pitying con<span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> me. I wanted to be rich myself, but I h<span data-el="supplied" data-cert="high" data-resp="pers:SL" title="Certainty: high.Supplied by: pers:SL.">a</span>ted, I detested, all who had wealth, for they seemed to mock me. He was the man who
               had brought us to poverty, who had sold my father up, beggared him, killed him. And
               yet he dared to pity me. He was the proprietor of a large manufactory, a man who paid
               poor girls to work for him from 75 cents to $1 a week, and yet was a pillar of his
               church, an M. P., an Honorable, in fact, my employer’s best client. One day he came
               to me and offered to help me, to give me his old clothes. I refused quietly at first
               but when he had left me I went nearly mad. To be offered old clothes! Had it come
               to this to be offered charity by mine enemy? Great God! W<span data-el="gap" data-reason="illegible" title="Reason: illegible."></span> so wretched <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span></div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p"><span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span>who was so proud.<span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> he brought her with him before, and she seemed a commonplace girl. He <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> few words meant to be <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> on my desk. All the time she <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> half curious, half pitying smile <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span> looked at the thing. It was a $10 bill.  <span data-el="supplied" data-cert="low" data-resp="pers:SL" title="Certainty: low.Supplied by: pers:SL.">I looked</span> at it dully, then I picked it up and flung it in his face. “Go,” I yelled; “go before
               I <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span>. He stepped back. He was so amazed he uttered not a word. He had expected to be overwhelmed
               with thanks, but his face was smarting from the strength with which I flung the bill
               at him. Gradually he recovered himself, but he was too well bred  <span data-el="gap" data-reason="damaged" title="Reason: damaged."></span></div>
