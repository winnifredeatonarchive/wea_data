            <div data-el="p">To a Portuguese great-grandfather the face of Moonshine
               
               owed its peculiar beauty. Moonshine had heard of this
               
               ancestor; a blot he was to her upon the proud Japanese
               
               genealogy of her family, despite the fact that he had been
               
               one of those remarkable Portuguese who brought to Japan the
               
               first knowledge of Western science. When her Japanese
               
               friends remarked that her eyes were yellow instead of black
               
               and her hair waved barbarously, she would apologize very
               
               humbly. But to the few foreigners whom she chanced to meet
               
               in Nagasaki, Moonshine traded on her nationality in order to
               
               win their favor.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               This fact, and of course her undoubted beauty, had been
               
               her attraction for Dudley. He was an American of the usual
               
               sort, seeing Japan through rose-colored glasses, marveling
               
               that he was not indeed in another world altogether. Despite
               
               the glamor of the land of poetry and flowers, however, never
               
               for one moment did he lose his own Western point of view.
               
               Nevertheless, he fell in love with Moonshine.

               Tomlinson, who was his intimate
               
               
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="416"/>
               
               
               
               friend and kinsman, had pleaded with him to give up the rash
               
               notion of marrying Moonshine; or, if he must do so, to
               
               follow the example of his countrymen and marry her only in
               
               Japanese fashion. Dudley had answered with a stubborn pride
               
               that would brook no criticism of the girl herself. She was
               
               above reproach. For this reason, and because he honestly
               
               loved her, he intended to marry and protect her with all the
               
               homage he would have given to any woman who became his wife.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Tomlinson had said: “She may be good and lovely and all
               
               the rest, you know, old fellow, but you never can tell just
               
               what to expect of these Orientals. The pagan must out in
               
               them.” To which Dudley returned:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “You forget that she is not entirely Japanese. She has
               
               always had ideas alien to those among whom she has had to
               
               live: she has always felt a stranger here. You will see,
               
               Tomlinson, as my wife, she will absorb in time our Western
               
               way of thinking and living, though I would not have her lose
               
               her charm of Oriental birth.” He added with a little
               
               confident laugh:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Really, Tomlinson, we'll make a bewitching little
               
               Christian of her yet.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Tomlinson went to Helen Martin at the Hotel Imperial.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Try and do something to dissuade him from this,” he
               
               said to the girl, who was strangely pale over the
               
               intelligence. “He will ruin his whole career if he lets this
               
               infatuation get the better of him.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “If Francis must marry her,” said Miss Martin very
               
               gently, “we should be thankful that he will do so properly.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Meanwhile, Moonshine made some important purchases at
               
               the chief European store in Nagasaki. In fact, she bought a
               
               corset, a pair of little patent leather shoes, silken hose,
               
               kid gloves, skirts, waists, and a bonnet.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               On the day of the wedding, she arrayed herself in all
               
               this finery before the little beveled mirror in her room,
               
               only large enough to reflect back her own exquisite face.
               
               All the morning she had labored on her hair, painfully
               
               endeavoring to dress it after some European mode which she
               
               had seen in an old Parisian fashion plate. The result was a
               
               trifle tousled, but nevertheless quite becoming.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Then she put the corsets on, pulling them hard by the
               
               strings, panting and breathing heavily with the exertion.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “I cannot bear this corset long,” she said, sighing
               
               hugely. She slipped a skirt on, then the waist, and somehow
               
               or other she managed to fasten them correctly. Next she put
               
               on the bonnet, then the gloves, several sizes too large for
               
               her, and last of all, she sat down on the floor, drawing on
               
               the little high-heeled Parisian shoes.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               When she was all quite dressed she slipped out of the
               
               house just as she was, glancing about her fearfully lest she
               
               might encounter some shocked relative. On the road the
               
               little dogs sniffed and barked at her, missing the familiar
               
               sound of her little wooden clogs. She reproved them gently:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Dear my honorable friends,” said she, “certainly you
               
               are not acquainted with any American lady. Some day, maybe,
               
               you will learn.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               At the church, they were awaiting her—Dudley,
               
               Tomlinson, Helen Martin and a fat missionary—whose deep,
               
               solemn voice made her shiver.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               At first, when she came to the door of the church, they
               
               did not recognize her in her changed attire, until she
               
               announced in a queer little subtle voice, as she tried to
               
               make graceful obeisance, despite the horrible corsets that
               
               caused her agony:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Dear my augustnesses, I come!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Dudley started violently and paled all over. His lips
               
               quivered fearfully as he went quickly down the aisle of the
               
               little mission church to meet her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “God bless you!” he said brokenly to her. “It is<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> all
               
               quite wrong—the clothes—but you did it for me!”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               After the first ejaculation of amazement at her changed
               
               appearance, the two witnesses composed themselves, though
               
               Tomlinson said in an audible whisper:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Good Lord! She has come all alone!”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               She replied to Dudley in a timid <span title="un- der" data-el="choice">
                  
                  under
                  </span> tone that had a tremor in it:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Pray excuse the honorable rudeness of my honorable
               
               relatives. They doan like me mek marriage with barbarian.
               
               But I also liddle bit like unto you, an' behold I jus'

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Dudley held her hand closely. She could not altogether
               
               follow the marriage service, but she went through it
               
               bravely, and repeated the beautiful words in a broken
               
               accent, with far less nervousness than Dudley, who was
               
               shaking like an aspen.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               After the ceremony, he took her straightway to his
               
               hotel, whence he sent word to her honorable family, which
               
               met in indignant counsel, solemnly and completely to disown
               
               her forever.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               During the first month of his marriage, Dudley raved of
               
               his unalloyed bliss to the cynical Tomlinson, who merely
               
               thumped him hard on the back, wishing ardently that it might
               
               continue. Aside he would say to Helen Martin:

            <div data-el="p">

               paradise.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Why?” Helen would demand somewhat impatiently, “she is
               
               all and more than we could have hoped.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Wait!” said Tomlinson, the raven, “I have lived long
               
               in the East. The pagan must out!”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Although he disapproved of his wife's habit of rising
               
               with the sun, Dudley awoke one morning very early. The
               
               glorious sunshine of Japan had forced its way in a golden
               
               stream through the closed shutters into the room. At an open
               
               shoji<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> he saw his wife almost before he was fully awake. She
               
               was sitting, with her back to him, on the floor. Before her
               
               was a little black lacquer box, its wide-open lid showing
               
               the shining surface of inlaid mirror. Over it her head was
               
               bending and her hands were very busy.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Dudley got out of bed noiselessly, thinking to startle
               
               her by coming on her of a sudden and catching her in his
               
               arms. But as he came closer to her he became at first
               
               interested, then mystified, and finally horrified at her
               
               strange occupation. She was smearing big blotches of red
               
               paint on her cheeks and lips. That done, she penciled her
               
               eyebrows in the finest lines. Finally she began doing
               
               something to her teeth.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Watching her in almost a fascinated silence, Dudley
               
               remained transfixed. When she had finished, the keenest eye
               
               could hardly have detected the make-up, he thought, so
               
               artfully had she laid it on.

               guilt. She even sprang up joyfully, running to meet him,
               
               with her small hands outstretched to his. He held her off.

               the paint, begging and coaxing to be excused from such
               
               humiliation. She could not bear to have him see her without
               
               what seemed to her one of the chief perquisites of her

               attempt to spoil her natural delicate loveliness with such
               
               hideous cosmetics.

               cosmetics caused him rapidly vanished. He even joked and
               
               teased her about it as he dressed himself.

               against the foot of the bed. Somehow, despite the chairs and
               
               couches about their rooms, she seemed to slip naturally to
               
               her little crouched up position on the floor, and her
               
               husband could find no fault with this little pagan habit,
               
               for she looked so quaint and pretty.

               pleasure how long and silky were the lashes that shadowed
               
               them. She appeared to be all attention, listening to him
               
               politely. Suddenly she put a question to him:

               indifferent to comment. He knew that her appearance had
               
               changed for the better, but he wondered that she should
               
               still have so much color, for he remembered how on that
               
               first day her skin had been peculiarly clear and creamy when
               
               she had washed the paint off it, with scarcely a tinge of
               
               color.

               with him to an entertainment at the American Consulate, he
               
               noticed a little red blotch on her nose.

               in his hand. It was stained in blurred red. Her honoroable
               
               nose was free of its scratch.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Without a word he led her back to their rooms. Holding
               
               her face over a basin he washed it clean with a wet towel
               
               end. After the flush resulting from his brisk motion had
               
               died down, he found she was quite pale.

               disobeyed me, but that you have deceived and lied to me.

               passion, “I destroy thad same honorable box. I buy

               and she dared not disobey him. The contents of the box he
               
               emptied into the fireplace. Then he smashed the box.

               For a few days following, her manifest unhappiness
               
               communicated itself to Dudley. His love made him quickly
               
               conscious of and responsive to her moods. She had been of a
               
               naturally exuberant and buoyant disposition; but now she
               
               became quiet and passive, a shadow loitering constantly in
               
               her troubled eyes. She went with him reluctantly, and often
               
               would plead weariness or illness in order to be excused from

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Moonshine brooded over her unhappiness. Despite the
               
               fact that she really loved the stranger she had married with
               
               all the force of her passionate nature, nevertheless the
               
               customs of her people were strongly implanted in her nature.
               
               She could not feel at home among the people with whom she
               
               now associated and who were almost altogether of her
               
               husband's nationality. They were kindly and beautiful, she
               
               admitted, but she resented their good-natured and humorous
               
               encouragement of her efforts to dress and act like them.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Why,” she would argue inwardly, “should she continue
               
               this struggle when all her efforts made her seem only the
               
               more a stranger among them, a guest as it were? And why
               
               should she be placed under this restraint and denied that
               
               which a Japanese husband
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="422"/>
               
               would have purchased for her? It was all very hard and
               
               bitter. She tortured herself with the thought that with the
               
               loss of her pot of paint her beauty departed also. She could
               
               not imagine Japanese feminine beauty without the lurking
               
               presence of a magic toilet box. Of course her honorable
               
               husband would continue to praise her face, but that was only
               
               natural. He did not wish to pain her by letting her know the
               
               truth. In this she judged him from a purely Japanese
               
               standpoint. A Japanese husband, she knew, would continue to
               
               assure his wife that she was beautiful, even long after she
               
               had become an ancestor (grandmother).

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Then Moonshine conceived a plot by which she would put
               
               her beauty to the test. Gowning herself in an exquisite dove-
               
               colored kimono, tied about with a lavender obi, with a
               
               little purple parasol shading her bare head, the hair of
               
               which was dressed after the prevailing Japanese fashion, and
               
               being careful to put no paint or powder whatever on her
               
               face, she went down to that quarter of Nagasaki where she
               
               had previously lived, hoping to encounter some of her old
               
               friends, who would surely enlighten her as to the truth.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               She had excused herself from accompanying her husband
               
               on a little business trip by wrapping her head up in wet
               
               linen in the morning and pleading a violent headache.

               At first, when Moonshine left the hotel, her guilty
               
               heart beat rapidly with the excitement and fear of her
               
               proposed scheme. She felt like a naughty child running away
               
               from home. But gradually, as the flying feet of her runner
               
               put a great distance between her and the hotel the fear
               
               vanished from her; she even forgot the fact that she had
               
               come out in Japanese attire and with her face untouched by
               
               any beauty save that of nature. A sense of delight possessed
               
               her as they neared the old familiar quarter of the town
               
               where she had spent nearly her entire life. She smiled with
               
               delight over her stolen holiday.

               not to lose sight of her, she started down the street,
               
               stopping at several stores to make small purchases for
               
               herself. She was bending over a silk merchant's counter,
               
               examining the quality of a rich obi<a href="#n4" data-el="ref" data-target="#n4">[4]</a>, when the titter of
               
               familiar, silvery laughter caused her to look up.

               into the open window and loitered upon the white face of his
               
               wife. It was ghastly in its pallor, for she had been
               
               suffering many hours.

               To his extreme horror, she crept on her knees to him,
               
               and, putting her head at his feet, began a piteous
               
               supplication for his honorable permission to purchase a
               
               little pot of paint.

               He raised her to her feet, and drawing her into his
               
               arms, tried to hush the sobs that had welled up from her
               
               little overcharged heart.

               are breaking my heart. Oh, why do you let such a foolish

               That night her sobbing slumber troubled him so he lay
               
               awake. Then he made a blunder. He advised her to notice how
               
               the American women of the finer class scorned the use of
               
               such cosmetics. In particular he held up Miss Helen Martin
               
               as a sample.

               He could not have said anything that would so quickly
               
               have offended the supersensitive girl. She had acquired an
               
               extraordinary aversion for the American girl, despite the
               
               fact that Miss Martin had sought her out and tried in every
               
               way to be kindly and friendly. Without the slightest cause,
               
               Moonshine was positive that in Miss Martin she had a rival,
               
               one who apparently could not conceal her feeling for Dudley,
               
               and one whom she knew her husband absolutely admired and
               
               respected.

               When Dudley had gone to the American Consulate for his
               
               mail, as was his morning custom, Moonshine drew from a
               
               hiding place her last remaining pot of paint. She thought of
               
               the pale American girl with hatred, as she rubbed the paint
               
               violently into her skin.

               He came back to Moonshine joyously. As she confronted
               
               him at the threshold with her shining, defiant eyes and
               
               painted cheeks, he staggered.

               After that, recognizing the impossibility of taking her
               
               to his mother, Dudley rented a little house in a suburb
               
               close to the city, where he installed Moonshine. His love
               
               had deepened to an all-absorbing tenderness and pity that
               
               was touching. It was with the utmost patience that he
               
               continued the struggle against the paint nightmare that had
               
               now taken up its abode permanently with them, for despite
               
               her spasmodic washings pure of her face, he knew that she
               
               never was without it in the house.

               Autumn had crept upon the land with stealing step. A
               
               melancholy sweetness pervaded hill and dale. The flowers
               
               were turning to the hue of the golden brown leaves, which in
               
               their turn reflected the colors of the dying sunset, when
               
               Moonshine awakened in the night and piercingly called for
               
               her mother. The old nurse that attended her refused to leave
               
               her side, and Dudley started out in the night, shaken with a
               
               great premonition of disaster and a vain hope to gratify the
               
               wish of the sick girl to have her mother once more with her.

               flung himself at his feet, and after bitter tears and
               
               lamentations told him of the death of his wife hardly an
               
               hour after his departure, and of the birth of an honorable

               Crazed and distracted with the horror of the tragedy

               they had previously lived, and where still abided a few of
               
               his friends. There, like one bereft of all hope on earth, he
               
               flung himself into Tomlinson's apartments. Tomlinson
               
               promptly sent for Helen Martin. After vainly trying to
               
               comfort the bereft man, they finally succeeded in prevailing
               
               on him to return to the little house which had so lately
               
               held his happiness.

               horribly silent when they reached it. Their own footsteps

               with ague, the husband bent over her still form, great beads
               
               of perspiration standing out on his own brow. Slowly, and
