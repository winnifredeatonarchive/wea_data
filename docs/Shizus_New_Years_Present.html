               Shizu's New Year's Present<br data-el="lb"/>
               By Onoto Watanna <a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>	
               
            </h2>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">	It was New Year's Eve. A gentle snow was falling everywhere and it was quite cold
               outdoors. Nevertheless, the
               people were laughing and chatting happily everywhere, and the fading sunset lingered
               lovingly about their happy,
               smiling faces. The treasure vendor came proudly along on his cart, calling his wares
               aloud, and stopping every
               once in a while to make a sale. A gay party of geisha girls, with arms linked happily
               about each other, passed
               down the main street, chatting and whispering and laughing together.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	They were planning what they were going to do with the presents they had purchased,
               for they were just
               returning from a shopping tour. One of the girls hung somewhat behind the others,
               and there was a constrained,
               sad look about her face, which contrasted with the happiness visible in the others.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Well, Shizu-san," said one girl, turning on her sharply, "you have not purchased
               so much as a piece of
               candy. How could you be so stingy!"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The girl did not answer. Her face had flushed a hurt, painful red. The girls continued
               whispering spiteful
               little things to each other, as girls often do.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	When they reached the tea garden, Shizu ran off by herself, and rushing to her little
               room, sat down on the
               mats, burying her face in her hands.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Oh, pitiful Kwannon," <a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> she said, "I have given all my money to my parents and
               now have not a sen left even wherewith to reward the kind Americazan lady." She sobbed
               bitterly. After a while
               another geisha girl joined her, and Shizu confided in and unfolded her trouble to
               her. The friend thought the
               matter over.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You say you were starving, and the Americazan lady bought you food?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The girl nodded her head.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"And she secured you this position?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Yes, but I have been here only one week now, and I have not saved anything."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Her friend thought the matter over, then she said very gravely: "You certainly owe
               a debt to the Americazan,
               which it would be most ungrateful for you to neglect. Come nearer, Shizu-san, let
               me whisper in your ear, for I
               see some one's eye peering through the fusuma <a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> and know they will hear us."	
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	So they whispered together for some time, and after a while, Shizu rose to her feet,
               her face grown suddenly
               bright and happy. She put her arms lovingly around her friend and thanked her for
               her kind advice.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Now the Lennards had lived in Japan so many years that many people regarded them
               almost as citizens.
               Therefore it was not at all extraordinary that instead of celebrating Christmas, as
               they would have done in
               America, they kept instead the New Year holiday with the Japanese. So it happened
               that they spent a great deal of
               money in decorating the house with bamboo and pine and in making presents to their
               friends and servants.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	On New Year's morning Mrs. Lennard got up very early, in order to see that all the
               presents for the children
               were in their right places and that no vagrant had been around to disturb them. After
               going carefully over them
               in the dining-room, she passed into the adjoining room where her servants were in
               the habit of placing their
               various little gifts for herself and family, for a Japanese servant never fails to
               present his master or mistress
               with a present at New Year's.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The American lady's sweet face softened as she looked at the various gifts which
               were laid on the floor, some
               of them addressed to her personally, some to her husband and most to the children.
               The room was in semi-darkness,
               as the blind was down. As she crossed the room to lift it, her foot came in contact
               with something that made her
               pause for a moment in fright, for it did not feel like any ordinary toy. She stopped
               in the darkness and touched
               it with her hand. Then she rose, shivering, and pulled the blind high up.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Lying sound asleep in the midst of the presents was a little figure. She was dressed
               in a rose colored
               kimono, and there were imitation flowers and ornaments in her hair. Mrs. Lennard could
               see that she had taken
               especial pains to dress her hair well and look as nice as possible. At first she did
               not recognize her. Then she
               went close, and saw it was Shizu. She did not wake her, but stepping on tip-toe crept
               back to her own room.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Walter," she said, shaking her husband, and then as he opened injured, sleepy eyes
               at her, she continued:
               "What do you think! I could not sleep toward morning and so crept down to look at
               the presents. Shizu-san is
               lying sound asleep among them."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"She has been stealing, I suppose," her husband said with an angry look of suspicion.
               "That's all the thanks
               you get for helping those beggars."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Don't, Walter, I can't believe it."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Well, I'll go down, anyhow," he said, "and fix it so she can't get out when she
               wakes. She'll find herself
               in a trap and will have to account for it."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	When Shizu-san awoke, she sat up blinking her little eyes at the bright sun that
               was dazzling them. She
               fancied she had drawn the blinds down before sleeping. Then she looked about her,
               and as she half-started to
               rise, she saw that both Mr. And Mrs. Lennard were in the room.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Her face suddenly broke into the most confiding, bewitching smiles. She crossed to
               where they were standing,
               and putting her little hands on her knees, smiled with pleasure and assurance.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You lig' me?" she asked.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"How did you get into the house?" Mr. Len-
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="5"/>
               
               nard asked, disregarding the girl's evident anxiety to appease them. His stern voice
               frightened the girl for a
               moment. All her sweet assurance vanished, leaving her with such a pitiful, questioning
               little tremor on her face.
               She pointed vaguely toward the window.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">"What have you taken?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The girl was so mortified now that she commenced to weep very bitterly.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I nod cum for steal," she said, indignantly.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Now Walter Lennard was just as hard and cranky as his wife was tender and kind.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"We didn't expect you to admit it," he said, coldly. "However,"—he pushed the fusuma
               apart,—"as
               it is New Year's you may go, but mind you, if we catch you again, off you go to prison."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Walter Lennard felt very righteous in his indignation, for had not both he and his
               wife helped the girl's
               family in diverse ways, in spite of being warned against her father by many who said
               he was a good-for-
               nought?
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Shizu <a href="#n4" data-el="ref" data-target="#n4">[4]</a> was shivering now. She crossed obediently to the door. Then she paused for
               a moment, her little heart breaking.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"What is it, Shizu-san?" Mrs. Lennard asked gently, thinking her husband had been
               too hard on the girl.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Thad you kind to me," the girl began wildly, "I thing' all the time what kin I do.
               So I spik' with Mimosa-
               san an' we thing' tha's best' I mek' you present, but if I have no munney, what kin
               I do? Tha's vaery sad nod
               have aeny munney. Tha's account I have no present for give you. Then I thing' I cum
               here, thinging tha's bes' I
               give you ME! jus' me! for present. You lig' me?" She paused a moment and smiled again,
               for she had forgotten the
               man's unkindness, and remembered only her mission. Then she continued, haltingly,
               "P'raps you thing' I nod good
               for vaery much? Yaes? You thinging thad? I worg' for you all day an' all nide, be
               true—good—foraever
               an' aever."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The American lady's eyes were full of tears now. They were turned on her husband
               in dreadful reproach. He was
               looking out of the window, his hands in his pockets, but his indifference was too
               studied, and his wife knew he
               was ashamed of himself.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She turned very gently to the girl. "And is that why you are all dressed up to-day,
               dear?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Yaes."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She put her arm affectionately around Shizu and kissed her, smiling through her tears.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Come, then," she said, "We'll show the children our sweetest New Year's present!"</div>
