            </h2>
            
            	           
            <div data-el="p">Ido worked in the neighboring silk mill. He was tall and lithe and strong, and the
               sun reflected in his hair and eyes. Every one in the little town knew his history,
               but no one knew Ido himself; for, although he worked among them and in their midst,
               yet he had always held himself aloof. When Ido had been a little boy at school, he
               had been very unhappy, because his school-mates had laughed and jeered at his strangely-tinted
               hair and blue eyes. With an American or English boy they would have understood, and
               perhaps never even noticed it particularly; but with a Japanese——? And when Ido was
               only fifteen years old his mother had died, and he was left utterly alone in the world.
               In the daytime he worked at the mill; at night he studied the English language. Far
               away across the waters lived his father's people.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido had never seen any of them, and they had never even heard of him; but he had
               never ceased to tell himself that he would know them and go to them some day. Had
               he been a happy child; had those about him not made him always feel that he was different
               from them, and—yes, that they despised and disliked him—perhaps Ido would never have
               dreamed of leaving Japan; but for many years, ever since his mother had died, in fact,
               he had lived a lonely, isolated life, with but one thought, one purpose; and that
               to cross the ocean and go out among those he imagined would be like himself and would
               understand him. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido remembered his father well, and oh, how he had loved him! He had been tall like
               a young giant. He was an English officer on one of the big men-of-war that had come
               to Japan. Somewhere in the little house where Ido lived all alone was a beautiful
               British uniform, with gold braid on the shoulders and down the front. Ido's father
               had told him that may be, some day he, too, might wear just such a uniform; but that
               was so many years ago—long before even the missionary on the hill had brought them
               the terrible tidings of his death at sea. Ido had some old English papers with an
               account of his father's death. He had learned it by heart almost, and, indeed, it
               was with these same papers, over which he had pored constantly, that he had kept up
               his knowledge of the English language.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	In the account of his father's death, it spoke of him as being the only child of
               Charles Arthur Montrose, and said, also, that he was unmarried. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido was only twelve years old then. “Ah,” he had said very gently to the mother,
               and trying to speak like a man, “they don't know about you and me, mother, but when
               I get to be older and can earn enough money, we will cross the west ocean and console
               his parents.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	But the little mother was inconsolable, and three years afterward, she, too, died,
               and Ido not only found himself alone in the world, but practically unprovided for.
               He had never known that, since his father's death, his mother had supported them both
               by doing dainty embroidery work for a large store in Tokyo, which was only a short
               distance from the little town where they lived. So Ido squared his young shoulders,
               left the school, crossed the fields and went to the great silk mill, the pulsations
               of which could be heard all over the little town.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“What is your name?” the stern-faced proprietor of the silk mill had asked him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Ido Charles Arthur Montrose,” the boy answered, quietly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Ido Chars' Arthur' Montose!” repeated the man. “That's queer name!” and added sharply,
               “What sort of name is that?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“English,” said the boy proudly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Hem! You not English?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido nodded his head quietly, “I am a half-caste,” he said. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	The man grinned a trifle, looking at the boy in his Japanese clothes, which were
               of the richest and finest silk.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“And you want work, like—like a laborer—a workman—you in those clothes?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Yes,” the boy answered. “That is all I have; just these clothes.” The man was still
               grinning, as though amused at the idea. Ido took a step toward him, imploringly. He
               pushed back his sleeves and showed the man his arms. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“See how strong I am! How brave!” He waited for the man to notice the big muscles
               on his arms, and then continued, “I can do much work in the factory, anything you
               wish me to do. I must work—must make the money.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“What you want to make so much money for?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Just—just to live,” he said. “I have no money—just the little house to live in.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Well,” said the man, slowly, “you can go work but you better change those clothes
               you have on.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Afterward he said to the foreman, “That new hand has the red in his hair of the barbarian.
               He is big, and a beast, perhaps; but he is also strong and willing. Give him plenty
               of work.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	And so Ido entered the employ of the silk mill. His life was no less desolate or
               isolated, for none of the men were companionable for him and he felt sure that they
               would understand him no more than the little children had done in his schooldays.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Several years slipped quickly by, and Ido was a youth of eighteen years. He was simple
               and gentle, and modest as a maiden. Many of the hands in the factory genuinely liked
               the boy, but none of them were intimate with him. In Japan the half-castes usually
               live to themselves; the Japanese look down on them. In the little town where Ido lived
               he alone was partly of English parentage. Perhaps, had he not been so sensitive, and
               had sought to mix with the people, he could have made many friends; but he was naturally
               shy and sensitive, and they did not approach him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Once one of the men in the mill had said to him, “Ido, why don't you marry some one,
               instead of living all alone like a hermit?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Who would marry me?” said Ido, with a sensitive
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="8"/>
               
               consciousness of the red in his hair, and the fluctuating color in his cheeks. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Lots of girls! If you wish, I will even let you have a look-at meeting with my sister.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh, no!” said Ido, hastily. “I—am—too young yet.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	The other one shrugged his shoulders, but he said to a few of the other hands, later
               on, “Ido is a fool. He could get into some family if he wanted to; but I believe he
               likes his desolate life. Well, if he does, who cares?” And Ido went back to the house
               alone and read the old English papers and books his father had left behind. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	One delicious, dreamy day in the month of April, when hill and field were decked
               with the exquisite delight of the cherry blossom, and the air was full of fragrance,
               Ido went out into the woods. It was a holiday; and Ido always spent his holidays in
               the woods. He was rather sad this day. Business had been very bad lately, and they
               were talking of cutting the wages down. The wages were already so small, and Ido's
               little fund seemed to grow only so very slightly, his trip across the ocean seemed
               very far off, and the boy was feeling despondent and discouraged.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“It will cost me—yes, surely, about two hundred yen,” he said. “Let me see; I only
               make eight yen a month, and I have to live out of that. Now, I have seventy-five yen
               in hand. It has taken me three years to save that much. The master said he would pay
               me more when I grew older, but he has not done so. Alas! It will take me many years
               yet.” He sighed, looking drearily out before him. After a time he rose to his feet,
               restlessly, pushing the hair back from his forehead. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“I am getting morose and gloomy,” he said, shaking himself. “This living alone is
               bad, they say. Maybe I'll soon grow as solemn and cross as the old Chinese sensei<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> who used to teach us literature. I wish—yes, I wish—I had somebody to talk to to-day—not
               any of the men from the factory—no; they wouldn't understand me. I am, indeed, different
               from them all!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	His reveries were interrupted by a cry that he fancied he heard in the distance.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“It sounds like a little child,” said Ido, pricking up his ears. The cry was repeated.
               It came almost from the heart of the wood, though Ido fancied it was not far off.
               He ran lithely into the wood, in the direction of the cry, answering it as he ran,
               with his hand to his mouth, “Hi! Yi! Hi! Yi!” 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Finally he came upon her—a distracted, frightened little figure—wandering tearfully
               about, with tangled golden curls about her face and in her eyes. The wide Leghorn
               hat had fallen back, and was hanging by the ribbons tied under her chin; the little
               white frock was soiled and stained.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido stood off a little way, and watched her a moment before approaching her. Never
               in his life had he seen anything like her before.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“I gotted lost!” she kept repeating, “I gotted lost!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“She is a little English girl,” Ido said to himself. “She is—like me. She—she—we
               belong to same people.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	The little girl continued crying pitifully to herself, rubbing her little fists into
               her eyes. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh!” she said, impatient with herself, “that don't do no dood to cwy. I won't cwy!
               No! Margery won't cwy any more—just squeam, and squeam, and squeam, an 'en some one's
               going to hear and take me to my mamma.” And so she screamed, “Mamma! Papa!” over and
               over, and frightened herself with her own cries, so that she fell to sobbing again.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Some one came out from behind one of the trees and knelt at her feet. The little
               girl was frightened at first. He had come so suddenly and silently. He began wiping
               the tears from her eyes, very softly. Then the little girl heard the gentlest voice
               in the world:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“You gittin' los' all 'lone, poor liddle girl?” It was such a soothing voice that
               Margery instantly dried her eyes and looked at him. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	He was a Japanese, that was certain; and yet Margery had never seen a Japanese with
               blue eyes in all her life! His were as blue as the skies. That alone was enough to
               take her from her own sorrows for a moment.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“What a very funny looking Japanese you is!” she remarked, gravely. “Please put me
               down.” He had lifted her up. “I'm too big to be carried,” she said, with great dignity.
               “Is you Japanese, sure thing?” she continued. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	He smiled gently at her—”Jus' liddle bit.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh!” Margery could not understand this.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Well, I got losted,” she said. “Please take me to my mamma and papa. I'm Margery
               Parrish, and I'm five years old.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Where do you live?” he asked.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh-h, I don't know that!” Her lip quivered, and she was going to cry again, but
               she pulled herself together. “Let me fink,” she said; “I fink we lives in—in Japan?”
               She put it to him as a question, for she wasn't sure herself. “We twavveled so much,
               you know,” she continued, apologetically. “Nurse, she tooked me for a wide in a funny
               little rickysher, an' nen she got out to go into a garden and see the dirlies dancing,
               an' nen I clumbed out and got losted.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Will you stay with me, an' be good liddle girl?” he asked her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“No,” she said, very emphatically. “You must take me to my mamma right away!” and
               she stamped her little foot, imperiously. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Bud, I donno where tek you. You come home with me, an' mebbe I kin fin' those parents;
               then I tekin' you to them. See—it gitting vaery dark.”
            </div>

               	The child was finally coaxed into accompanying him, and permitted Ido to lift her
               in his arms, and carry her across the fields to his home.

               	She did not cry after they reached his house, but sat, very solemnly, on the little
               mat Ido placed for her, and ate the meal of rice and fish that he had prepared for
               her, for she was very hungry.

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh, that's too bad! If I didn't love my mamma and papa so much I'd like to stay
               and be your little girl.” She looked very thoughtful a moment. “P'raps my papa and
               mamma don't mind me to stay wif you a little, little while—just a little while.” She
               smiled engagingly at him, and crept into his lap. “You like me to stay little while
               with you?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido nodded, mutely.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“Well, I'm going to,” she announced. She went to sleep in his arms, and all the night
               long Ido held her there, even after he had lain down himself.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Next morning she helped him tidy the little house all up before he started out, and
               she would chatter and prattle and laugh as she followed him about the house. Ido got
               down some old playthings and trinkets he had had when a child, and then he carried
               her across the street, and for the first time in his life paid a visit to a neighbor.
               He told them about his finding the child, and asked them if they wouldn't have the
               little one with them through the day to play with their several children, offering
               to pay them for her care. So, all morning, Margery played with the little Japanese
               children, and at noon Ido came home and ate his lunch with her, and went back to the
               factory, to return at night. And after he got home Margery made him tell her tales—something
               he had never done before in his life, but which he did very well, making them all
               up out of his head. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	And Margery would raise her pretty little red lips, and say, “Kiss me, Ido,” and
               he, blushing like a timid little boy, would lean over to be kissed; for, you see,
               the Japanese do not kiss, and Ido did not understand how to, either.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	This lasted for a week. Margery was very good, and seemingly content. But every night
               she would say to Ido, “To-morrow I must go back to my mamma and papa,” and when to-morrow
               came she would forget. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	One day Ido picked up a copy of the English “Hansei Zasshi,” a weekly paper which
               is published at Tokyo in the English language, as well as Japanese. It was nearly
               a week old. Ido loved newspapers—especially English ones—and he always devoured every
               bit of reading matter he could find. He read the little paper over eagerly, and even
               ran his eye down the advertisement columns. Then he came to this column, in heavily-leaded
               type:
            </div>
            	           
            <div data-el="q">“LOST—Strayed from her nurse, somewhere in the woods, about fifteen miles from Tokyo,
               Margery Dorothea Parrish, only daughter of Edward Parrish.”
            </div>
            	           
            <div data-el="p">And then the advertisement went on to voice the anguished cry and prayer of the parents
               to any one finding her to return her at once. There was mention, too, of a reward,
               but Ido did not notice that. He had grown very pale, and was trembling. For a long
               time he stood looking out of the window, his mind and thoughts in confusion. Margery
               had been the first gleam of sunshine that had come into his life since his mother's
               death, and he had learned to love her with all the intensity of his nature. Ido had
               always wished for a dear little sister. When he was a boy, his chief prayer to the
               gods was always, “Please,—a little sister,” but she had never come—till then.

            <div data-el="p">
               	The foreman called to him sharply to go on with his work—the noon hour was over.
               Ido started and stared, stupidly, at him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“I—must—go to Tokyo,” he said, vaguely.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“What?”

            <div data-el="p">
               	They were very busy this day, and the foreman was ill-tempered.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“You can't go,” he said, shortly.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“Ah, I must, surely.”

            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido grew paler and hesitated.

            <div data-el="p">
               	But only for one day. He could not afford to lose his position.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“You stay or go,” the man said, doggedly. Ido went.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Come, liddle Marg'ry,” he said to the child, and told her where he was going to
               take her. She left the playthings and hugged him ecstatically.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“Oh, you dear, dood Ido!” she said.

            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido smiled. He had had her little white dress washed, and now put it, very gravely,
               on her, tied the sash and arranged the hair, trying to fix her as much like when he
               had found her as possible. All the time she chatted, and danced with delight at the
               prospect.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Then he lifted her up in his arms, and she put hers tightly about his neck, and whispered
               that she loved “her dear, dood Ido.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	Ido stopped to ask her, solemnly, “Forever?” and Margery agreed, with an emphatic
               hug.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	As he passed the neighbor's house, whose children had played with her, he told the
               mother where he was going.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	“And you are going to walk?” she said, in amazement.

            <div data-el="p">
               	“Yes,” he said, simply, and started down the long dusty road which led to Tokyo.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               	It was very dark when he reached Tokyo, and Margery was sound asleep in his arms.
               Ido had never been in the city before. He stopped a jinrikiman<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> to ask the way to the English Windsor Hotel. The man told him, and he continued on
               his way.

            <div data-el="p">
               	 On the piazza of the hotel a number of the guests were sitting. Ido went up the
               steps. They could not very well see who he was, in the semi-darkness, or what it was
               he was carrying; but he addressed a man who stood at the head of the steps.

            <div data-el="p">“I lig see Mr. Edward Parrish,” said Ido, shyly. “Mr.——?” he stopped short, noting
               the child in Ido's arms. “Good heavens!” he called to the others, “he has Margery
               here!” They all came about him now, the men with their hands in their pockets with
               lazy interest, the women grabbing the child from him, with delighted, excited little
               gasps. She had been the delight of the hotel. They all knew and loved her.

            <div data-el="p">
               	Some one had carried the news to the mother and father; the former had been prostrated

               	Ido stood back in the shadow of the balcony. “And these were the people to whom he
               belonged,” he was thinking—“these pink-faced, beautiful people.” He had thought himself
               different from the Japanese. His heart was faint. Was he<a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> not more different from these?

            <div data-el="p">
               	Three months later, Ido was in England. Mr. Parrish and his wife had made the return
               trip especially to take Ido with them, and help him find his people; for, of course,
               they had learned the story of the boy's life and nationality. Mr. Parrish went alone,
               first, to see old Mr. and Mrs. Montrose. They had never heard of their son's marriage—knew
               nothing of Ido. Their feelings were mingled; but, when all doubt had been swept away,
               the one that was paramount was the desire, anxiety, to see Ido.

            <div data-el="p">
