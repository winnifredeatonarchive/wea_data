            <div data-el="p">For fourteen consecutive days she had remained before the
               
               shrine, eating no food, drinking little water, sleeping not.
               
               Mechanically she went through the monotonous motions,
               
               bending her body back and forth, until it seemed like some
               
               mechanical puppet, working clock-like back and forth, her
               
               parched, weary lips uttering only the feeble common prayer
               
               of the devout Buddhist: <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Namu, Amida Butsu!</span>” (“Save us,
               
               Eternal Buddha!”)

            <div data-el="p">
               
               A venerable bonze, almost blind and entirely bald, slipped
               
               his rosary drowsily from finger to finger. Tokiwa saw him
               
               not, though well she knew that he was at her side, and ever
               
               her dry lips intoned: <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">“Namu, Amida Butsu!”</span> Thus, for
               
               fourteen days. Then she dropped forward, her brow striking
               
               for the last time the stone feet of the great image. The
               
               bonze, assured of the completeness of her penance, carried
               
               her aloft into the great hall of the nuns. There he left
               
               her, in peace at last, and started upon his pilgrimage.

               Many years before, hundreds of monks had congregated
               
               before this same, then-

               gorgeous, altar, chanting their splendid ritual; but the
               
               fanatical Nichiren sect had pointed out to the world the
               
               faithlessness of its priests—who ate the forbidden meat,
               
               who lived in open luxury and licentiousness, who flaunted
               
               their wealth in the face of a poverty-bowed world, and whose
               
               political power knew no limit. A zealous band of bigots of
               
               this rival sect attempted to burn the monastery. It had
               
               withstood the assault of the incendiaries, but the marks and
               
               ravages of the attack were physically upon its walls. It
               
               became uninhabitable for monks of wealth and ambition. For
               
               years it remained untenanted, a weird yet rugged old mass,
               
               stripped of its wealth, but not its beauty—deserted,
               
               falling to the decay of neglected age.

               A bonze at the Court of the Emperor, an eager missionary
               
               and loyal servant, incurred the displeasure of the Emperor's
               
               master, the Shogun, or warlord of Japan. Without warning his
               
               family had been attacked and practically exterminated.
               
               Driven from pillar to post, he found himself at last a
               
               deserted fugitive, with nothing remaining to him but the
               
               dear one at his feet, she who had followed him upon all his
               
               wanderings. In the act of committing <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">seppuku</span>, he perceived
               
               the wide, appealing glance of the child upon her back. It
               
               too, still lived. Swiftly the sword was replaced, and he set
               
               himself another task. He penned a humble petition to his
               
               enemy, finding in a fisherman a willing courier to the
               
               capital. His request was granted. He was ordered to shave
               
               his head and retire to the ruined monastery on the shore of
               
               Kamakura.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               In this retreat, the broken-spirited bonze gave himself up
               
               to a life of prayer and piety. Here the child, Tokiwa, grew
               
               to girlhood in solitude and innocence. From the first she
               
               had been given by her grandfather as a sacrificial offering
               
               for his sins to the Lord Buddha. She knew no speech save
               
               that couched in the language of prayer and admonition. To
               
               her, life meant one constant act of expiation, of prayer,
               
               fasting, for mortal sin committed in some former state. She
               
               accepted her lot piously, humbly, sweetly. Only sometimes
               
               she could not forbear running out into the sunlight, to
               
               smile at the blue skies above her, to stretch out her hands
               
               to the stars, to whisper back to the golden fields which
               
               spread out beyond their overgrown temple gardens.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Not even the people from the nearest village visited the
               
               deserted temple, save when rare pilgrimages were made to the
               
               place; and then they who went told, with shudders, of the
               
               unspeakably old, blind bonze at the shrine, and the weird
               
               sprite face of the child nun, who danced alone in the
               
               deserted temple, to please the gods.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               
               
               It was summer. The bees had made a hive in one of the out-
               
               jutting eaves of the temple. The world was saffron colored,
               
               the hills, the skies, the fields, dim purple. A traveler
               
               pushed his way through the tangled brushwood, and paused
               
               before the ruined temple. He stood like one lost in the
               
               meshes of a strange dream. So deserted and still seemed this
               
               refuge he had sought that at first he wondered dazedly
               
               whether indeed there was life within.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Then he saw the sliding of the window screen, and Tokiwa
               
               leaned far out. She reached up a slim bamboo rod, poked at
               
               the eave and dislodged the hive. A moment of retreat from
               
               the angry bees, and then she cautiously slipped the <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">shoji</span>
               <a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>
               
               open again and obtained the coveted honey. Within arm's
               
               length of the sacred shrine, she crouched upon her heels,
               
               eating the sweet morsel she had stolen.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               A sunbeam came through an opening door and fell like a
               
               searchlight upon her little startled face. She thought of
               
               the reverend bonze, remembered her devotions, and thinking
               
               now only of her sins, fell upon her knees, putting her face
               
               upon the floor. A strange voice spoke her name, very gently,
               
               and she looked up slowly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

               When she had recovered from her human amazement, she
               
               answered that she was indeed, miserably, that sinful and
               
               guilty worm, Tokiwa, grandchild of the temple bonze. Then,
               
               human feelings again assailing her, she asked: “And thou?”
            </div>

            <div data-el="p">To which replied the boy, with a smile strangely sad:</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Like thyself, a poor exile and fugitive, seeking an
               
               asylum from Shinran, the bonze, once my august father's
               
               friend and servant.”

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Now Tokiwa knew nothing of the history of the times. She
               
               knew little indeed of her own history, save that in some
               
               former state she had sinned grievously, hence her expiation
               
               in this present life. Of the state of unrest and oppression,
               
               of civil war, of intriguing factions, of intolerable
               
               humiliation of the Mikados<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a>, she had heard never the
               
               faintest murmur. To her, the Mikado was a God, the chief of
               
               all indeed, for this the bonze had taught her, clinging
               
               still to the Shinto belief despite his Buddhism. In the
               
               tangled reasoning of the child mind of Tokiwa, the world
               
               without was very good and beautiful. People there were
               
               joyful; they did not need to suffer for their sins. The gods
               
               were not punishing them. Penance was reserved for such
               
               benighted ones as she.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               Now here, apparently, stood before her another sinner like
               
               herself, one who said he too had been driven into exile.
               
               They were kindred spirits, twins in suffering.

               She went toward him slowly, wide-eyed, her cheeks and lips
               
               red as the poppies tossed at the feet of the great Buddha,
               
               for Tokiwa was too poor to make a richer offering. With
               
               small hands crossed upon her bosom, like some fascinated
               
               creature, she stood in silence, looking at him, very near to
               
               him—so near,

               indeed, that he inhaled the breath of the incense in her
               
               garments, the subtle odor of <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">umegaku</span>
               <a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a> and the pine. It clung
               
               about her, upon her garments, in her hair, her very body.
               
               Her eyes were like liquid pools of dense blackness into
               
               which his own seemed to have leaped and lost their soul.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               “Tokiwa!” he whispered lowly, and now he reached and
               
               touched the little crossed hands upon her bosom. They did
               
               not unclasp, but they trembled under the warm touch of his
               
               hand.

               She began upon her prayers, but her voice caught upon the
               
               words. She could not finish them. Never in her life before
               
               had a human hand held her own; never had she looked into the
               
               eyes of a fellow mortal. The stone gaze of the Buddhas was
               
               calm, with a wisdom past understanding, but never they
               
               smiled, and always the touch of their feet, where daily she
               
               put her small meek head, was cold. Unconsciously her own
               
               lips and eyes caught the infection of the boy's smiling
               
               gaze, and, as she smiled, again he spoke:

               Some vague feeling of unrest stirred within her. She
               
               clutched her heart tightly, as if to stay its tumultuous
               
               beating.

               lavish<a href="#n4" data-el="ref" data-target="#n4">[4]</a> luxury of the imperial court. It had been customary
               
               for the Shogun to raise its Mikado in this effeminate form,
               
               making him merely a child in intelligence and hence a
               
               figurehead in authority. His features were delicate, his
               
               arched eyebrows as sensitive as a poet's, his lips as full
               
               and pouting as a child's. He had a tender chin and brow. His
               
               eyes were large and long, and somewhat melancholy, but there
               
               were latent hints within them of a stronger power possible
               
               of awakening. He was slim of figure and exquisite in his
               
               bearing. He moved indolently, but with grace.

               their white fingers, revealing the golden heart within. A
               
               hand, white as the lotus itself, pushed its flat-shaped

               Prince Go-Yoshi she had dreamily watched the slim outline of
               
               her small, reflected hand upon the water and thus had

               However it be, for seven days she had obeyed the
               
               injunction of the reverend bonze. She had performed her
               
               devotions in another part of the temple, mindful that it

               someday be, or mayhap was already. And so to him she intoned
               
               her perpetual prayers. Of him she had dreamed, and waking,
               
               dreamed again. Unconsciously the words he had spoken came to

               drawn there by the eternal feminine within her, to prove

               own, there in the water beneath. For a moment she did not

               the small pink shell of her ear, she turned to him

               Like our best hopes which elude us, they slipped one by one
               
               from the branches, leaving them bare, hungry, naked! But

               White Dew, you and I met and loved. You were a white

               always I wandered restlessly about, seeking prey for my
               
               death sting. I saw you asleep on the heart of the poppy, and
               
               slipping up behind, I found my way, bent upon your
               
               destruction. Suddenly you fluttered your white wings upward,
               
               and then—in my dream, Tokiwa—I saw your eyes, just as they
               
               are now, beloved, and all the evil dropped away from my
               
               heart. I was no longer a <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">gaki</span>; but a palpitating repentant,
               
               pleading with the Lord Buddha to make me worthy of your

               These were the troublous times of the Hojo rule, when for
               
               the first time in the history of Japan the emperor's
               
               condition was so deplorable that often he knew not the
               
               bodily comfort of an ordinary citizen. At the cruel mercy of
               
               the warlords, their condition was pitiable. One boy emperor
               
               was set up only to be deposed for another, often his own
               
               infant son. So rapid was the change from one boy emperor to
               
               another, that princes of the true blood and direct line were
               
               now nearly exhausted. Yet this was the rule of Hojo. Infant
               
               sovereigns, divine figure-heads in the eyes of the world!
               
               And the real Mikado in exile!

               Now Go-Yoshi's turn had come; but not as a puppet went the
               
               boy back to the great capital. His father, already banished
               
               to Oki, needed succor. The Prince Go-Yoshi heeded the
               
               impassioned promise of the gallant little army which had
               
               rallied to his support. He planned to assist his father to
               
               recover the imperial power, and this at the price of his own
               
               forfeit of the throne as a puppet of Mikado.

               and burning fortress of Kasagi in Yamato, Go-Yoshi gave

               brought strange tidings, and a promised solution to the

               fairest of all islands shows its face of eternal green. The
               
               ocean tosses its waters upon Enoshima's shore like a great,

               enthroned as Queen of the World, above all, Fuji-yama raises

               Whither? There was no enemy to be met and destroyed
               
               hereabouts. The lately rebellious Mikados, father and son,
