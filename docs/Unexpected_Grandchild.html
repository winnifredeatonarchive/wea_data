            <div data-el="p">All afternoon she had pored over the story. Now, as she
               closed the book, her face still held its absorbed expression
               of pain. Her cheek-bones were flushed, her eyes snapped
               feverishly. She looked as if she wanted to express her
               thoughts violently to somebody.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Somebody, as it happened, just then opened the door,
               after a light tap, and thrust in a bright, laughing face.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Still reading, ladykins?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No, I have finished the story. I will say, it—affects
               me horribly!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The girl, a pretty young thing of twenty, moved her fan
               vigorously. It was hot, and she would much have preferred
               being out somewhere, pulled along in a jinrikisha<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a> through
               the fascinating streets and parks. But she herself had lent
               the book to her prospective mother-in-law.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It is a dear tale,” she admitted good-humoredly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Dear!” repeated the elder lady. “It is a bit of life—
               tragedy—here in Japan! I feel it—know it must have
               happened scores of times.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She turned somewhat irritably toward the maid who had
               silently entered the room and as silently had thrust a tray
               before her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No, thank you.” Then to Gertrude: “This is the fourth
               time this afternoon they have sent up the tray. I've already
               said no. Kiku is so officious that if she did not happen to
               be the only maid here who speaks English, I believe I———
               What are you waiting for?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Kiku smiled, that ever ready, mysterious smile, half
               humility, half as though she laughed within herself. She was
               a diminutive, brown-faced city wench, who, so the Howlands
               had learned, had once been a geisha. In some way or other
               she had acquired a certain knowledge of the English
               language, and as she was really an excellent servant in
               spite of the suspicion of superciliousness about her, she
               was in great demand about the hotel.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Aexcuse”—now bowed the smiling Kiku—“bud mos' humble
               one got frien'—mek a nize call unto Okusama. She mek a beg

               foreign young miss.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Not at present.” Mrs. Howland shook her head.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, do let them,” interposed Gertrude sweetly. “You
               know we should be just as interested in a Japanese bride's
               trousseau, and———”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Very well, then. Kiku-san, you may take your friend
               into Miss Gertrude's room, but be very careful to touch
               nothing.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               For a while Gertrude, at least, listened to the
               tittering and whispering on the other side the partition,
               which was very fragile. Mrs. Howland, however, soon called
               for her full attention.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Do you know what I think of these Japanese marriages?”
               she demanded—“the ones between foreigners and native
               girls?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No; what do you think, dear?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I declare that they are just as binding as any other
               kind of marriage.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She arose and stood looking fiercely at the inoffensive
               Gertrude.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “If a son of mine contracted any such union,” said she,
               “I should force him to bring his Japanese wife to me, and I
               should protect her, if necessary, from him.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The murmuring in the adjoining room had ceased, and
               from the two peep-holes, quite plainly shown on the wall, it
               was clear that the Japanese girls were attracted by the
               Okusama's deep and commanding voice.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Here,” she went on oracularly, “we have before us the
               candid, tragic tale of a girl victim of some brute
               countryman of our own.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “But it is only a tale!”

            <div data-el="p">
               “The man who wrote it knew,” declared the older woman
               vehemently.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The man who wrote it lived all his life in
               Philadelphia,” laughed the girl.<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a>
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Howland regarded the girl severely.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “My dear Gertrude,” she said coldly, “It is immaterial
               where the author lived. The fact remains that such things
               happen daily in Japan. It is a well known thing.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Gertrude turned away, sighing slightly, and, leaning
               from the window, she stared wistfully up the street.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I wonder where Noble is,” she said softly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Why, in Yokohama, of course. He must finish that
               contract, you know.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes, I do know; but I just wondered—for the moment—
               where he was, and what he was doing.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               She arose languidly, most of her bright look gone.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I'm going for a little ride, dear. Good-bye for the
               present.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Howland, alone, continued to regard the book
               fixedly. She
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="686"/>
               
               was a woman of turbulent emotions and commanding nature.
               Though outwardly big and almost mannish, her expression
               concealed a heart of such extraordinary charity that her
               very indignation over the wrongs of others fixed her
               features harshly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Twilight was settling, and the smoothly matted chamber,
               with its bamboo chairs and furnishings—a concession to
               foreign guests—was becoming quite dark. The lady with the
               book became aware of this. She set it down and crossed the
               room to ring for lights, absently surprised that Kiku had
               not come sooner to perform this service. A photograph of her
               son, insecurely tacked upon the wall, served to distract her
               attention. There was a glint of light across the face, which
               smiled out at his mother in an engaging, boyish fashion. She
               looked at it steadily, the severity of her face slowly
               softening away.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “My boy!” she said gently; and then: “Thank God he is
               different!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               As she opened the door she nearly walked into the
               little figure pressed up there against it, her head drooped
               downward, the face hidden in the long, loose sleeve of her
               kimona. Mrs. Howland started back with an ejaculation of
               astonishment. For a moment she remained staring at the
               little figure before her. Then, her hand trembling slightly,
               she touched the girl's arm.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You are in trouble. What can I do for you?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The hump upon the girl's back suddenly moved upward,
               showing a baby's small, round head. A little gurgling sound,
               a soft chuckle of baby joy, was the only answer she
               received. Mrs. Howland's heart beat with a great mothering
               thud. At the same time, the maid, Okiku-san, in her
               noiseless stockinged feet, pattered into the apartment and
               one by one lit the lamps. Her face with its perpetual smile
               seemed more mask-like than ever, and as she went from the
               room her narrow slits of eyes seemed barely to rest upon the
               visitor now slowly raising her head. The face Mrs. Howland
               found herself looking into was like one she had dreamed of
               or imagined. It was pretty, after a doll-like, babyish
               fashion. The cheeks were round and rosy, and the eyes,
               palpably meant for mirth and laughter, were full of a
               child's appeal. Now Mrs. Howland placed her. She was exactly
               like the heroine of the story, even to her poppy-crowned
               head and rosy kimona.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What is it, dear? Can you speak English?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yaes, honorable one.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “What can I do for you?”

            <div data-el="p">
               Two little hands were instantly extended to her.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, mos' high up one, pity me!” said the girl
               tremulously. “I—I got a breagin' ad my heart!” and she
               clutched her heart tightly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You poor little creature! Tell me your trouble.”

            <div data-el="p">
               Every fibre in Mrs. Howland was now athrill. So here
               before her was one of the very victims of which she had
               heard and read. So full indeed was her heart that she could
               not find words to express herself, a condition in the lady
               almost unbelievable. Her feelings, however, were destined to
               a new laceration and shock, for the girl went on, her words
               gathering headlong speed with the earnestness and pain which
               apparently possessed her:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Howland's face was like a gray, paralyzed mask.
               She could not move. She could not speak. Her boy! She stared
               fixedly, glaringly, at the girl, who had again thrown out a
               pair of exquisite little hands. Her tremulous voice seemed
               overfreighted with tears.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">

               The handle of the door turned, but ere it opened Mrs.
               Howland was pressed against it.

            <div data-el="p">
               Her young strength was greater than that of the older
               woman, and she forced her way in. Her face was still white
               with the unknown fear she had experienced when the other
               woman had held her out. Nor did the color come back to it as
               she looked from the intruder to Mrs. Howland. The older
               woman was speechless. She had covered her face with a pair
               of trembling hands and had sunk down limply into the nearest
               chair. The baby on the girl's back tossed itself upward and
               waved its small fat fists triumphantly.

               Suddenly Mrs. Howland leaped frantically to her feet.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Let me look at it!” she cried hoarsely, and seized
               upon the baby. Her eyes widened with horrified emotion as
               she saw the color of its hair and eyes, the one tawny red,
               as was her own son's, the other blue as the sea, as were her
               son's.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Dear Mrs. Howland, for pity's sake tell me what does
               it mean? Why are you so agitated? Who is this girl?”

            <div data-el="p">“My poor, poor child!” said Mrs. Howland hoarsely. “My
               heart bleeds for you. But”—and she turned heroically toward
               the Japanese girl, whose face was again hidden in her
               sheltering sleeve—“but right is right. We as women, as
               sisters to this poor, betrayed creature, owe her a duty and-
               -reparation! What my son refused to give her, I will—
               protection!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Mrs Howland—”

            <div data-el="p">
               “Gertrude, it is better you should know the truth, and
               you must try to bear it like a woman—a brave and noble
               woman. This girl is my son Noble's wife, and this—his
               child!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Gertrude stared at her with an expression almost of
               hatred, so intense was her horror of the woman's statement.
               Then with only a lowly whispered “Oh-h!” she slipped
               forward, fainting for the first time in all her strong young
               life.

               Mr. John Noble Howland, Jr., was inditing a love
               letter. He sat in his pleasant office—he was an architect
               of Yokohama, catering chiefly to the foreign residents who
               had their bungalows on the cliffs—before a long table, upon
               which various maps and papers were laid, apparently in
               excellent order. Having covered fifteen pages with closely
               written terms of endearment, he coolly proceeded to end the
               letter with a series of circular marks. Apparently they had
               some occult meaning comprehensible only to the one who
               should receive the epistle, for presently he chuckled, and
               then, with an impulsive, boyish movement, stooped and put
               his lips upon the aforesaid circles.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He had barely sealed the letter when his secretary
               brought him a telegram, and acquainted him for the sixth
               time with the information of the waiting clients without.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “In a minute,” said the American cheerily, opening and
               smoothing out the telegram. “What the——— Well, what's the
               matter with old mater now!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The telegram he held read as follows:
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="q">Come at once to your wife and baby with me. God
               forgive. Gertrude cannot.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">He re-read the telegram with deepening amazement, then,
               swinging about in his chair—
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Hi, Taku! Mistake here. Somebody else's wire,” and he
               gave the paper back to the secretary.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               But as he turned over the letter he had just written to
               Miss Anderson, the words of the telegram kept sticking in
               his mind: “God forgive. Gertrude cannot.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He ran his hand nervously through his curly crop of
               auburn hair.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Strange!” he said. “If it wasn't for that confounded
               contract,

               I'd light out for Tokyo. Just like mother to insist upon
               settling there, with me stationed here. Poor little girl,
               coming all the way here to marry a homely duffer like me—
               and here I am cooped up with——— What is it now, Taku?
               Another telegram?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He slipped his finger under the flap and opened the
               envelope. He turned pale as he read. Then a slow flush
               darkened his face, flooding his neck, too. He had the
               outraged, indignant look so often worn by his mother.
               Muttering an oath, he picked up his hat, slammed it down
               upon his head, and fairly rushed out of his office, passing
               the waiting clients without a word. The telegram this time
               had been very plain:
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="q">Leave for U.S. at once. Return all gifts to you.
               Never want to see your face again. —G. Anderson.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">Meanwhile another individual had received an equally
               confounding wire. He was having the time of his life. Away
               from all home dissenting or opposition, Mr. John Noble
               Howland, Sr., was enjoying a little fishing trip in
               secluded, peaceful Sendai. He was a little man, with a
               wizened, anxious face, which nevertheless showed a hint of
               an abundant sense of humor. His brows puckered comically as
               with adjusted glasses he read the following message:
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="q">Come at once. Noble has wife and baby. Gertrude
               leaves for U.S. at once. —Ellen.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">“Dear me!” said the little old gentleman, scratching
               the back of his ear. But he fished all of that morning and
               most of the afternoon ere he answered the telegram:
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="q">Bless and forgive young people impetuous action.
               Will return soon as possible.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">The answer to this came at night, when he was awakened
               from a most delightful slumber:
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="q">Gertrude not wife. Come at once.</div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">This looked more serious, and the old gentleman's face
               was stern as he prepared to start for Tokyo.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Attired in an orange-colored kimona, decorated with
               silver storks and reeds, the red-haired baby looked
               incongruous and fascinating. His eyes were the brightest
               blue, his skin as white as milk, save where the cheeks
               expanded on either side into two rosy red balloons. He was a
               noisy little chap, given to loud and engaging laughter.
               Unwelcome perhaps he may have been upon his arrival, but by
               constant and
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="690"/>
               
               persistent degrees he had laughed and chuckled his way into
               the hearts of even the stoniest disposed toward him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Howland had accepted him as a matter of duty, and
               not, as she sternly assured Gertrude, from any motive of
               affection. Before retiring, however, she had not resisted
               the impulse which induced her to go to the impromptu bed
               prepared for the little stranger. There he lay in a rosy
               sleep, his fat legs outside the covers. His hair was one
               mass of ringlets; one fat thumb was snugly tucked into the
               diminutive mouth. Mrs. Howland turned away quickly, the
               choking feeling in her throat and the new fluttering at her
               heart causing her to look even more severe, as though she
               fiercely sought to fight against impending tears.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Twice in the night she stole out of bed to reassure
               herself that he was covered up—the nights were chilly—and
               almost before the dawn the lady was panically answering the
               first demands of the morning. He was howling like a good
               fellow for his milk. She aroused Kiku and sent her flying in
               search of milk or baby's food, and meanwhile she walked the
               floor with the rampant infant clutched warmly and closely to
               her now thoroughly thawed-out heart.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “After all,” she apologized to herself, “he's mine—my
               very own little grandchild. I understand my feelings now.
               It's nature! There, there, there, lovey, in a minute, in a
               minute. Milky comin' in a minute!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Duly fed and changed, master baby resumed his customary
               humor, and, to the amazed delight of his now doting
               grandmother, ejaculated these two clearly spoken American
               words: “Da-da!” and “Mum-mum!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “To think,” said Mrs. Howland, “that the poor creature
               actually taught her baby to speak its father's language!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               This feat of the baby's was too much for her to keep to
               herself, and she obeyed the fond impulse to confide in
               Gertrude. In her now overwhelming infatuation for the baby,
               she had almost forgotten the condition of the girl. She was
               quickly recalled to this, however, as soon as she entered
               Gertrude's room. The young girl's face looked pinched and
               faded. There were peevish lines of pain about her mouth. Her
               eyes were dark and wild-looking. She turned a bitter,
               reproachful look upon the elder woman.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “My poor, poor———”

               “No, you need not pity me. Besides, you don't really

               “I know all about it. I saw you with—with that———

               shall have to bear—the—the——— Oh-h! to think of my
               coming out here—leaving my home. Papa knew. Papa guessed.
               That's why he insisted that we
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="691"/>
               
               wait. That's why he imposed the condition on Noble that he
               should go away and do something—achieve something. He has.
               He has. A hideous little heathen imp!”

            <div data-el="p">
               Mrs. Howland's face had undergone various changes of
               expression. First anxiety, melting pity, then outraged
               pride, indignation. She was standing as severely and sternly
               now as a statue.

               terrible! I shall be a laughing-stock. Oh!—I! Think of it!
               And you talk of your grandchild! You are all wrapped up in

               “No, no, dear child:” and she knelt beside the girl and
               attempted to draw her to her, but Gertrude pushed her away,
               her little hands fairly hurting as she shoved Mrs. Howland
               aside and stood up.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Gertrude!” Mrs. Howland's voice broke. “You know I

               Gertrude began pushing back the loose hair from her
               face, and searching about the little bamboo stand for her
               brush.

            <div data-el="p">
               “I don't like babies,” said the girl peevishly. She was
               brushing her hair now with a feverish little hand. “Besides,
               I've no time. I'm going to catch that steamer, if possible.
               I'm going to see about my ticket, and—go—home. I hate
               Japan! It's a horrid, detestable place, and the people look
               like—like monkeys.” She set her hair in place with a final
               vicious twist.

               A bitter, sneering smile had curled up the lips of the
               girl at the unconscious look of maternity which had softened
               the entire face of Mrs. Howland.

               “Oh, go, go!” cried she banteringly, pushing her along.
               “Yum-yum wants you. There! I'll go with you, too!” and she
               flung out of the room recklessly, pushing the older woman
               along.

               Upon a woollen blanket which had been spread upon the
               matted floor, before a warm hibachi, the little baby lay. He
               was upon his back, both fat little legs in the air, the foot
               of one gleefully enclasped in a round, dimpled hand. He was
               in a frenzy of delight, induced by his erstwhile successful
               efforts to sit up halfway and also his

               ability to put his toe into his mouth. His mirth appeared to
               increase at the approach of the new-comers, and, as if to
               perform for their especial benefit, he rolled over on his
               stomach and endeavored to raise himself to his knees by
               pressing his two little hands upon the floor. Then he rolled
               over on his back again. He lay still for a moment, suddenly
               sobered. His eyes, going from the admiring nurse to the
               emotion-choked grandmother, had finally fallen upon the
               pale, working face of Miss Gertrude Anderson. A smile which
               opened up his rosy mouth, showing the four ridiculous little
               teeth within, and displaying every adorable dimple encrusted
               in his fair fatness, was directed fully at the girl.

               suddenly she slipped to her knees, and, with her face hidden

               John Noble Howland, Jr., burst open the door of his
               mother's sitting-room. She looked up from her fascinating
               employment to see him glowering there in the doorway.
               Setting the baby down, she arose and faced him. At the same
               moment Gertrude came into the room from an interior
               apartment. Her face looked lily white and ethereal. It was
               to her impulsively he turned. Something in the girl's face
               went to his heart. He forgot the bitterness of thought he
               had been enduring. He knew only that Gertrude, the girl he
               loved, was suffering.

               She drew herself up. Her eyes met his squarely. They
               whipped him with their icy contempt. She condescended not
               one word. He turned to his mother. His voice was husky,
               stupid. What is it, mater?”

               not wither under the lightning looks of scorn and
               indignation cast upon him. Gertrude, without a word, had
               stepped between him and the baby, as if to shield it from
               pollution even by sight of its unwilling parent. Seizing it
               in her arms, she cuddled it up against her neck, murmuring
               words of pity and endearment.

               with a mole upon each, as I, your mother, can testify is

               everybody has moles on their heels.” He went into the next
               room, slamming the door so loudly behind him that it seemed
               as if the whole hotel were shaken.

               Meanwhile, Howland, senior, was speeding along through
               the intricate streets of Tokyo in a little jerking vehicle
               propelled by manpower. He had been travelling all night, and
               now, dusty, sleepy, and tired, he listened with only half
               interest to the monotonous shouting of some vender, or
               jinrikiman, as he took him to be. The man had a gigantic
               sign, a square-faced lantern, upon which black letters were
               printed. This was carried aloft upon a stick. Whatever the
               message or advertisement, it was printed on the four sides
               of the lantern. As he drew nearer to the jinrikisha of Mr.
               Howland the latter saw that half of the lettering was in
               English. He leaned slightly out of his carriage and read:

            <div data-el="p">The man whirled the sign about on his stick, and when
               next it was visible to the now more distant rider he could
               see only the illumined lettering of the name of the European
               hotel where his own family were stopping. The incident
               troubled him, for he was of a tender-hearted disposition;
               besides, foreigners in Japan really have a brotherly feeling
               at bottom for one another. He jogged in discomfort along.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               As they drew up before the hotel, Mr. Howland noticed
               that the rooms occupied by his family appeared to be all
               lighted, even his son's. Apparently they were still up,
               though it was past midnight. Noble must be in Tokyo—the
               scamp!

               He knocked before entering his wife's sitting-room, and
               some one within hastily opened the door. There in various
               rigid attitudes of antagonism were his wife, his son, and
               Gertrude. The latter was smiling slightly, but in a
               contemptuous, baffling way. Noble had his head thrown
               defiantly back, his hands thrust in his trousers pockets. He
               seemed to have just come from the adjoining room, for the
               door was still half-opened behind him.

               Mrs. Howland, strong, self-reliant lady, let forth a

               She had clutched hold of him as if he were some rock of
               salvation which would save them from all further peril. He
               turned inquiringly first toward his son and then toward
               Gertrude. She spoke with a bitter brightness:

               “Isn't it?” snarled Noble, who looked like a great,
               sulky, angry boy. “I did pick up the little cub. Went in to
               take a look at it. It was friendly disposed at first, then
               started to howl. So I dangled it to hush its cries. I always
               did like kids!” he added defiantly.

            <div data-el="p">“The facts are these,” put in his wife ponderously: “a
               Japanese girl claims to be the wife of your son. She says
               they were married about a year ago. He, like other
               foreigners who contract these abominable unions, considered
               it but temporary, and accordingly deserted her and her
               child. On account of dear Gertrude here, I insisted upon his
               wife's returning to her own people, for the present at
               least, which she was eager indeed to do. I gave her ample
               money to defray all expenses. To me the case is a most
               tragic one, but for one illuminating item. Oh, John, the
               baby—our own grandchild, John—is—beautiful!—and the

               running one after the other down the full length of the
               hotel corridor. The first of these rooms was Gertrude's.
               Then came the sitting-room, which opened into Mrs. Howland's
               room, and, finally, at the end of the hall, was the room
               always reserved for Noble.

               On this night the head of the family, tired and
               badgered, and ardently desiring a long, silent night of
               peaceful rest, wisely opined that there was no prospect of
               this if his room was to be shared by an uncertain infant.
               Accordingly he timidly suggested to his wife that the baby
               sleep in the sitting-room. She spurned the very thought of
               such a thing. The idea! Never had she seen such an
               extraordinarily good baby before. Why, it slept clear
               through from its ten o'clock bottle till a little before
               five. Mr. Howland blinked at the thought of that five
               o'clock awakening. That blink was fatal. Instantly his wife
               pounced upon it. Her words belied her injured tone.

               “While I, his grandmother, would not think of leaving
               him in a room by himself, there is really no occasion, John,
               for you to sacrifice your own comfort. There's an unoccupied
               room, I believe, in the very next corridor. Go down to the
               office at once and secure it.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “I will,” said her husband unflinchingly, and,
               whistling with gay bravado, he obeyed his wife's injunction.

            <div data-el="p">
               It was a nice, square room, the last but one at the end
               of the long hall. The big enamelled bed looked inviting to
               the tired one, as he
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="696"/>
               
               proceeded to pull off his boots. So sleepy was he that his
               head was nodding even while he buttoned his pajamas, and as
               his head finally touched the pillow a deep breath that was
               in itself a gentle snore escaped him.

            <div data-el="p">
               The clock pointed to 1:45 a.m., an hour when reasonable
               night-quiet might be expected even in a Japanese hotel. At
               1:55 he suddenly sat up in bed with a start. In the darkness
               he remained sitting, with his ears pricked up. He struck a
               match, looked under his bed. Then he lay down again.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Two minutes later he again sat up, his queer little
               face thrust out alertly. Plainly in the silence and darkness
               he heard the low moaning and sobbing of a woman in distress
               or pain. So weirdly did the sound at first strike him that
               he imagined it ghostly, and could not stir. A fit of
               shivering seized him. The perspiration dripped down his
               face. He managed to get out of bed, fumbled around, found
               his clothes and matches, and lit the lamp.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Presently he heard the sound of some one in the
               adjoining room—it was the one at the end of the hall—
               tramping heavily across the floor, and the low wailing grew
               louder, wilder. Then suddenly it was muffled, and a man's
               voice sounded gruffly above the moaning. Whatever he was
               saying or doing appeared to arouse the sufferer to a sudden
               wild activity the next moment. The trembling old man in the
               next room could hear her as she sprang to her feet and
               plunged in some headlong rush across the room. He heard them
               struggling within, and, trembling as if afflicted with ague,
               Mr. Howland crept to the bell and pushed it.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Presently it was silent again in the adjoining room,
               and he heard the man trampling heavily across the floor, as
               though bearing some heavy load in his arms.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               No one answered Mr. Howland's summons. He thought of
               opening his door and calling for help, arousing one of his
               family. How ardently he wished he had remained with his wife
               this night! But he was in a condition of real terror. Here
               in a strange “heathen” country he was conscious of the
               possibility of unknown crimes.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               By and by he crept back into bed again, but, even with
               his head under the covers, all through the night he heard
               the woman crying and the dull steady walking of the man, as
               if on guard, back and forth, back and forth, until the dawn.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               Noble Howland was sleeping the sound, dreamless sleep
               of healthy, guiltless youth. He too was tired out. He had
               spent an entire day and a good part of a night trying to
               induce two “cracked” women to see that it was impossible for
               him to belie his name—Noble. On the one hand he met the
               outraged, indignant regard of his mother, and on
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="697"/>
               
               the other the bitter, contemptuous, wild regard of the girl
               he loved. He did love her—that was the beastly part of it,
               he told himself. He loved her desperately and madly in spite
               of her cruelty and delusions. When he retired he could not
               efface from his mind her pale, scornful little face. It
               tormented him. He seemed to see the tears and heartache
               which showed like a shadow behind all her vaunted scorn and
               indifference.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He finally dropped off asleep, and slept unmoving until
               the dawn. Then some one awoke him, and he turned over in bed
               to hear his father's voice. Sleepy as he was, its tone
               aroused him, and he stared up at the shaking, gray, haggard
               little figure standing there by his bed in the dawn.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Dad!”

            <div data-el="p">
               He sprang up impetuously, throwing his arm about the
               old man and drawing him down beside him.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Are you sick? Here, lie down. Get into my bed. Jove!

            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He was out of bed in an instant. The old gentleman
               swallowed the stimulant at a gulp.

            <div data-el="p">

            <div data-el="p">
               The father shook his head, moistening his lips. Feebly
               he told the boy the incidents of the night.

            <div data-el="p">
               “And they did not answer your ring? Well, I bet they

               pressed to the button until the hasty patter of feet along
               the hall was heard and a very much disturbed little bell-boy
               answered his summons.

               He wondered vaguely as he put the question whether he

               A wide, capacious grin slowly spread itself over the
               countenance of Noble Howland, Jr. He turned to his father,
               but that gentleman was snuggled up under the warm bed-
               clothes and was sleeping at last, soundly and peacefully.

               “Hold on a bit,” said Noble, lowering his voice. Then
               he scribbled hastily upon a pad of paper:

            <div data-el="p">He signed no name. With a chuckle, he handed the note

               It was fully two hours before ten o'clock that the
               occupants of room No. 22 assailed the door of room No. 8. In
               point of fact, they had rushed out the instant they had
               found and read the note.

            <div data-el="p">
               Some one was singing inside room No. 8. It was a
               woman's voice, very low and crooning, and she sang some
               little nonsense song of a baby who sailed away on a lullaby
               ship on a slumber sea, to return on a sunbeam with the day.
               The woman outside the door knew the song too—had sung it
               herself once upon a time—and now she clutched her husband's
               arm, and sobbed against it in a way that was quite heart-
               rending to see. The singer had stopped as their knock
               sounded. Then she called, “Come!”

               Mrs. Howland rose quickly as her visitors entered. She
               had thought it was the late Kiku, who had again disappeared.
               The woman, whose wan face looked as if it had been literally
               washed out with tears, turned a pair of feverish eyes upon
               her.

               “My note!” exclaimed Mrs. Howland. “There must be a

               A look of enlightenment and of intense pity dawned on
               Mrs. Howland's face. The poor creature was demented. The
               loss of her child had driven her mad. Oh, surely she, Mrs.
               Howland, knew how to sympathize with such a suffering one,
               and she knew a salve which might soothe even a heart as sore
               as this poor mother's.

               The last word escaped her like an explosive. She saw
               the eyes of the woman before her dilate wildly. Then, with a
               cry that was like that of some entrapped animal suddenly set
               free, she had darted forward. She tore the baby from the
               arms of the panic-stricken Gertrude, and then in an agony of
               bliss crushed it to her heart.

               Mrs. Howland essayed several times to attract their

               The man was looking at them now, his lean, grave face,
               with the troubled, sleepless eyes, studying them slowly, as
               though he dully speculated upon their exact relation to the
               matter.

               three days ago by a vicious nurse whom my wife was obliged
               to reprimand. We later learned she was an adventuress, an ex-
               geisha, who took positions with foreign families coming to
               Japan, with the object of robbing them in some way. Last
               night it was learned another conspirator assisted her, who
               also acted as maid here—Okiku by name—perhaps you know
               her? She has gone—probably got wind that we were on her
               track. Her going prostrated my wife last night, as we had
               thought Okiku might give us some clue. I feared my wife's
               reason was giving way—that she would injure herself; but
               now, you see—she—she—will be herself again!”

            <div data-el="p">

               “Oh, don't you remember?” put in Gertrude, with a voice
               half vibrating with tears and half with a joy of which she
               was fearful. “They were there that day, Okiku and her friend-

               would befriend and protect the Japanese wife of your son.

               Mrs. Howland did.

            <div data-el="p">
               “It's clear as day to me now,” said Gertrude. “We have
               been deluded idiots—both of us!”

               The man and the woman were going, the woman too
               entranced even to turn to hear or heed the explanations.
               Mrs. Howland choked as she watched them, and two great tears
               rolled down her furrowed cheeks.

            <div data-el="p">
               “I—I—loved that baby,” she said. Then, after another
               silence, she added slowly and painfully: “And I gave her
               five hundred dollars. I could not conceive of a Japanese
               adventuress. It seems incredible even now.”

            <div data-el="p">
               Her son mopped up her tears in a roughly affectionate
               manner, half chiding, half loving.

            <div data-el="p">
               “And to think,” she added, gulping down a great sob,
               “that I believed my own son capable of such villainy!”

               “Oh, you weren't the only one,” said he jauntily. “Now,
               you take your punishment like a good fellow, mamma. Go in
               there and blubber it out alone. I want to chastise
               Gertrude.”

               After Mrs. Howland had gone the pair remained in a
               silence which to one of them at least was hard to bear. She
               was holding herself very stiffly, her proud little head
               drooping not one jot from its height. She knew very well
               that he was standing squarely in front of her, gloating over
               her discomfiture. Finally she could bear it no longer.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Anyhow,” she said shakily, “its hair was red.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “A color you despise?” he questioned politely.

            <div data-el="p">
               For the first time she looked at him directly, and
               instantly her face flamed.

            <div data-el="p">
