            <div data-el="div" data-type="part">
               	              
               <div data-el="p">Sessue Hayakawa. Once a name to conjure with in the motion picture world. Star of
                  the first magnitude. His fame
                  comparable to that of Valentino. His admirers legion. The star who opened the great
                  Strand Theater in New York, and
                  kept it packed for months.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	One of the mysteries of Hollywood has been for four years why Sessue Hayakawa suddenly
                  dropped out of pictures. What
                  were the causes that led to his exit at the very peak of his popularity and fame?
                  Why, literally overnight, did he
                  close his magnificent residence, discharge all of his servants, except a couple of
                  caretakers, and disappear from
                  Hollywood?
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	A recent announcement in the newspapers gives forth the information that Hayakawa
                  is about to return to the screen.
                  His first picture is now in process of production.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	Perhaps, thought I, Hayakawa will now speak. It may be he will want his host of friends
                  and admirers to know the
                  reason why he deserted the work he loved so well. With this thought in mind I called
                  upon him. Almost the first
                  question I put to him was:
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“Why did you leave the movies?”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	He looked somewhat startled by the direct question. He stared a moment, and then
                  gazed off absently into space, as
                  though turning the question over in his mind. After a moment, hesitantly and as if
                  temporizing, he replied:
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“Perhaps several reasons contributed. I did not like the stories I was required to
                  play in.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	He smiled slightly.
               </div>
               
               
            </div>

               <h3>Any Story at All</h3>
               
               	              
               <div data-el="p">“The last story was picked like the toss of a penny. I was given three stories to
                  choose from. I do not like
                  any of them. Still they insist I must choose one of these. So I say: 'Eenie, meenie,
                  mynie, mo!'
                  and put my
                  finger on one. A story picked like that cannot be good. It is a gamble. Impossible
                  to put the warm heart into it. I do
                  not play well where is not my heart.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“Surely you did not drop out of pictures because of that?” I asked incredulously.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“Oh, no; oh, no!” said Hayakawa, hastily. “That was just one of many irritations.”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	He thought a while, his face somewhat stern. Suddenly and almost roughly he spoke:

               <div data-el="p">
                  	“I will tell you. I will tell you the true reason. It was something deep. It strike
                  me inside!”
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	Hayakawa smote his chest hard. His dark eyes were smouldering now like black coals.
               </div>
               
               <div data-el="p">
                  	“It was something said to me that no true man should speak, and no true man can hear.
                  Something that should not
                  come out of the mouth. It was, you understand—not decent.

               <div data-el="p">
                  	“I was associated with certain men in motion picture enterprise. They owe me $90,000.
                  I never ask for this
                  money. I think there is plenty of time to pay. Perhaps it was that they think too
                  much about this debt. They

                  think it good to goad and humiliate me—to pick a quarrel. I do not mind a quarrel.
                  It is all one side, you
                  understand. I let them say this, that, or what they wish, and I do not make reply
                  with my mouth. Then it is that one
                  of them—the chief one—get very angry, and he called me by a name. It is something
                  should not come out of
                  the mouth. Something that is unpardonable insult to me and an affront to my nationality.
                  No man can help where he is
                  born—what is his blood. Only an ignorant coward throws up to a man that he does not
                  like his race. I come of a
                  proud people—a man of my quality could not endure such insult. Still I did not speak.
                  I stare at his face, but I
                  say nothing. He say then 'People in this country have no use for Chinks.' I am not
                  Chink. I am Japanese gentleman, and
                  the word Chink is not fit to be spoke. I continue merely to stare at him, and speak
                  no word. Every man in that room
                  look uncomfortable. Then I bow with politeness to all and I leave that room.”

                  $90,000 for? I disdain to
                  reply, but next day this is how I answer: I attach every piece of property of that
                  company permitted by law. That same
                  day, I dismiss all my servants—I close up my house and put caretaker in charge; I
                  cancel all engagements. I said
                  to myself: 'Now I am all through.' I take many little insult and humiliation—but no—nothing
                  so big as
                  this. I do not wait for any legal consequence of my action, but that night I take
                  train for San Francisco, and from
                  there, immediately I sail for Japan!

               <div data-el="p">
                  	Hayakawa drew a great breath. I think he was glad that the thing was out—out of his
                  system. He had nursed a
                  hurt so long that it had rankled intolerably. He had thrown over his career for an
                  insult.

                  	“Too kind! In Paris I made a Japanese picture called 'The Battle.' I had expected
                  to return to Japan to make
                  that picture, as it was necessary to have many battleships. The French Minister of
                  War solve my problem. He put at my
                  disposal seventeen French battleships. He made me a Commander in the French Navy.
                  Already I am a Japanese naval
                  officer. Every day come to me the captain, salute and ask: 'How many ships today,
                  sir? How many men you require?' They
                  put the Japanese flag on the French battleships. The French sailors and officers put
                  on Japanese uniforms. Even the
                  daughter of the Minister plays in picture as compliment to me. It was marvelous! Such
                  generosity! What enthusiasm and
                  exquisite consideration! What inspiration! We create a great picture. In one theater
                  alone in Paris it runs for three
                  years.”

                  hurt. Before returning to
                  pictures, he determined to discover to what extent his popularity had waned during
                  his long absence. He tested this
                  out in a coast to coast vaudeville tour, where he was the headliner, and played to
                  packed houses. Wherever he went, he
                  was enthusiastically acclaimed.

                  their voices; they will fear their effect and grope for the lines. This doubt will

                     after only 44 performances. As a publicity stunt, Eaton sued Belasco for plagiarizing
                     from her work; Belasco, in turn,
                     sued Eaton for libel. (For more on this colorful episode, see Diana Birchall, Onoto
                     Watanna: The Story of Winnifred
                     Eaton; U of IL P, 2001: 79-84.) The story of Madame Butterfly by 1929 was, of course,
                     well known, given the continuing popularity of Giacomo
                     Puccini's 1906 operatic version of the original 1898 novella by John Luther Long,
                     as well as the 1915 film, directed
                     by Sidney Olcott and starring Mary Pickford (a 1932 version—sans Norma Talmadge—starred
                     Cary Grant in the
                     role of B. F. Pinkerton). <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">A Japanese Nightingale</span> was produced as a film in 1918 but flopped;
                     although Eaton attempted several times to revive interest in the film when she worked
                     at Universal and MGM in the
                     1920s, she never succeeded.
