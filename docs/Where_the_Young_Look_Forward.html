            <div data-el="p">Perhaps one of the sweetest characteristics of the
               
               Japanese is their innate love, obedience, and respect for
               
               their parents. The Japanese character in this respect has
               
               not its parallel the world over. To a Japanese the word
               
               “duty” might be said to be the most significant word in the
               
               language. But the Japanese interpretation of the word has a
               
               far different meaning to the generally accepted one. Duty,
               
               to a Japanese, means not merely obedience and discipline,
               
               but strong, sweet, cultivated, parental devotion. I use the
               
               word “cultivated” because this feeling has been and is
               
               cultivated in Japan. Nevertheless it does not lose its
               
               naturalness. On the contrary, this devotion of the young for
               
               the old—the adoration of the parent by the child—becomes a
               
               natural cultivation. It is exemplified not only in the
               
               larger and formal acts of Japanese life, but in the minutest
               
               and smallest detail. The little Japanese child obeys without
               
               question, and generally in a lovable, willing manner, the
               
               gentle “demand” of its parents, and even in cases where the
               parents are harsh the natural love of authority is still
               
               there and the child is obedient.

            <div data-el="p" data-rend="center">*    *    *</div>
            
            
            
            
            <div data-el="p">The parents' word is always law in Japan, and perhaps
               
               this accounts for the sweetness and gentleness of the
               
               Japanese character. The Japanese are inherently an obedient
               
               people. The old always take precedence of the young in all
               
               things. An eager, impetuous young man, be he ever so
               
               brilliant and clever, is not expected in Japan to have the
               
               reason, the wisdom, and the foresight of an old man.
               
               Therefore the old man comes first always. As a result, there
               
               is, perhaps, more general happiness in Japan than anywhere
               
               else in the world.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               One might imagine that where duty is carried to the
               
               extent it is in Japan the natural love is not so much in
               
               evidence—I mean the actual affection, rather than the mere
               
               duty, of a child to its parent. On the contrary, the natural
               
               bond of affection between parents and children is nowhere so
               
               wonderful as in Japan. No matter how unkind, unjust or even
               
               wicked the parent may be, or how depraved, the child
               
               invariably clings to that parent, even though, as is often
               
               the case, its own nature be finer.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               There exists in Japan a certain custom of adopting
               
               “from the cradle.” A childless couple will very often adopt
               
               a child, taking it generally as soon as it is born. The
               
               child's real parents may have been people in every way
               
               inferior to its adopted parents. The little one may be
               
               reared by the foster-parents as if it were their own child,
               
               and not allowed to know, when it is possible to conceal it,
               
               who its real parents are. By exercising their influence over
               
               it, and treating it with affection, the little one,
               
               believing them to be its real parents, gives them, in
               
               return, all the love that their own child would.
               
               Unfortunately, these adoptions cannot always be kept secret,
               
               and sooner or later the child, generally when it is just
               
               stepping from childhood into youth, is apprised of the
               
               truth. The consequence is remarkable. The child, to all
               
               appearance, will be as respectful, obedient, and devoted to
               
               its adopted parents, but there is something lacking,
               
               something is gone that was there when it had believed the
               
               foster-parents were indeed its own. The child, in such a
               
               case, will endeavor in every way to conceal its feelings in
               
               order that the parents may not regret their bargain.
            </div>
            
            
            
            
            <div data-el="p" data-rend="center">*    *    *</div>
            
            
            
            
            <div data-el="p">Still more surprising is the zeal with which the child
               
               will set about to discover its real parents. Be they low or
               
               high, they are nevertheless its blood kin, and in Japan the
               
               blood tie is strong almost to exaggeration. In some cases
               
               these adopted children will find that their true parents are
               
               much inferior to the ones they have always loved, and while
               
               they will respect and obey the latter, there is a strange,
               
               indescribable affection for the real parents, even though
               
               they be comparative strangers to them. This is a peculiar, I
               
               might say inherent, characteristic of the Japanese—this
               
               cleaving to kinship with a tenacity that is full of heroism,
               
               and, indeed, not infrequently filled with pathos.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               A very pretty custom in Japan is the praying and
               
               speaking to the dead parents. Long after the death of good
               
               parents, their children will talk and pray to them, and a
               
               peculiarity is that they do not pray for blessings on
               
               themselves, but they themselves bless the departed ones, for
               
               it is said that the prayers and blessings of the living
               
               affect the new life of the dead to this world. One can,
               
               therefore, see how desirable it is to have the love of one's
               
               children, so that for peace in the hereafter they may have
               
               their blessings.

            <div data-el="p">
               
               The Japanese religion exacts that no man may be very
               
               wealthy and his relatives poor, and teaches that it is more
               
               blessed to be old than young—two very beautiful things. Is
               
               it not refreshing to find one spot on earth where age has no
               
               terror to the young; where the young gladly look forward to
               
               even extreme old age? There is no such thing as dread of old
               
               age in Japan. And I wonder if in America we might not rob
               
               age, old age, of its horror if we honored it more? Is it not
               
               better to ever believe, as do the people of Japan, that the
               
               old are ever the best?
