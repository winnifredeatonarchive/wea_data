            <div data-el="p">	Yuki folded her hands and piously drooped her head. She was converted. Behind her,
               Matsu smiled beneath her
               affected frown, and the minister coughed slightly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You, Yuki," he said, with fatherly graciousness, "shall accompany us. I feel we
               shall have cause to be proud
               of you. And you—" He turned to Matsu, and cleared his throat. Her eyes were meekly
               drooped also now, and
               her hands folded, though, unlike Yuki, she had not fallen on her knees. As the minister
               paused, her lips moved,
               and she said, with the queerest intonation:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Me?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You are hardly yet prepared," he said, gently.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The eyelids flashed up. There was a prayer in the depths of the dark eyes.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"A-a, <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">ple-ease</span>, excellency, me also," she said, dragging her words pleadingly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The minister's composure vanished. He tried to look severe, and kept his gaze resolutely
               averted from the
               little upraised face; then his eyes encountered one beseeching little hand outstretched,
               and he fluttered.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Yuki finished her prayers and rose to her feet, turning a reproachful look on her
               friend. To the minister she
               said: "Matsu nod understan' to be good." This very apologetically, and with a resigned
               shake of her head. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Me?" said Matsu, with superb passion. "Am good—mos' gooder'n all."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Then why you nod pray?" demanded Yuki, "an' also why you nod baptize? An' also why
               you nod b'long ad thad
               church of Jesu Christ an' Sav'or?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Hah!" said Matsu, with vehemence, "tha's account I <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">too</span> good!" She caught her
               breath guiltily and stood confessed.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I nod mean thad," she said, pitifully, but it was no use. Yuki was glad Matsu had
               betrayed herself. She went
               off slyly smiling, and left the minister and Matsu in the Mission house alone. It
               was dark inside, and the gloom
               of the place made the girl shiver. She looked out wistfully to where the half-opened
               door let in a stray gleam of
               the fading sunlight. The minister pushed the door wide, and they passed out together
               and walked side by side
               toward the crest of the little hill on which the Mission house stood. It was not the
               first time they had together
               watched the sun set.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The United Missionary Society had quite recently requested the return to America
               of the minister, and had
               also authorized him to bring back with him to America two of his subject-converts.
               Now both Yuki and Matsu had
               been adopted by the Missionary Society since they were little children, and had grown
               up in it. Yuki, meek,
               submissive, sweet, pretty, and passive, was the pride of the entire Mission, but Matsu
               was as far from the Cross
               as the day they had taken her in, a hungry, forlorn, fighting little morsel of humanity,
               clad in rags and dirt,
               whom one of the workers had found in the streets. No one had ever taken the trouble
               to find out who she was or to
               whom she belonged. It was the custom of the Mission house to take in such waifs, and
               moreover, it was an
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="138"/>
               
               easier matter to educate these children and bring them up in the Christian faith than
               it was to make converts
               among those who had ingrained into them, and were satisfied with, their own older
               religion. But Matsu was,
               unfortunately, untrainable, and, although a product of the Mission school, reflected
               discredit on that worthy
               institution, and it was the custom of the workers there to keep her out of sight on
               the occasion of visits from
               sundry foreigners who sought to investigate the work of the Mission. Had it not been
               for the minister, who had
               been moved from Osaka to Kyoto a year before, Matsu would have been turned adrift,
               for she had arrived at the age
               of fifteen, and it was the judgment of the missionaries that, since she could not
               be brought to conform to their
               belief, she should not be permitted to remain in the school, where her radical ideas
               and opinions were anything
               but conducive to discipline.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	But the minister had acquired a peculiar fondness for the little maid. She exercised
               a strange influence over
               him, and while he sternly disapproved of her naughtinesses and recognized to the full
               the evil effect on the
               other children likely to result from her association with them, he was in the habit
               of shielding and even
               concealing her failings from his associates. Moreover, he never attempted to argue
               with her, or even to teach
               her, and in this way really had more influence over her than if he had done so. She
               would go to him and confide
               to him her little troubles, her thoughts, her queer fancies.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The minister knew his fondness for Matsu was in a measure perilous, for though no
               one else had perceived
               anything out of the ordinary in his friendship for her, the girl herself was cunningly
               well aware of it, and
               elfishly worked upon his weakness. Now her heart was set on going to America, and
               she was using all her wiles and
               smiles and witcheries with that end in view. It was really a serious crisis the minister
               was facing now. Much as
               he would have liked to take Matsu with them, he was yet seriously affected by the
               idea of what the result would
               be if she, with all her wilfulness and mockery and defiance, was set as a type of
               the convert from the Mission
               school.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	As they walked along slowly together he debated within himself.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"No," he said, suddenly stopping. "It is out of the question, Matsu."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Please, excellency!" </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"No. Don't beg like that, Matsu," he said, nervously. "It's no use. You must understand,
               you ought to,
               how—how absurd it would be, how it would hurt me, in fact. You wouldn't want me to
               get into trouble, would
               you, Matsu?" he asked, softly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She shook her head, and then suddenly caught at his sleeve, her eyes shining with
               a quick inspiration.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Bud—sup-pose I <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">gitting</span> converted?" She put it to him seductively. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He gasped. </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Ah, that would be different, then, little girl," he answered, quickly, and looked
               stealthily at the alluring
               little hand, that had somehow found its way into his. He wondered at its power of
               expression. Her eyes danced
               now.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I am convert!" she declared, promptly.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"<span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">You</span>—now?" He began laughing, and she, encouraged, joined with him joyously.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Yaes; see me? I am convert, so—so," and she dropped on her knees and began imitating
               Yuki's pose to a
               nicety. Her lips moved, she clasped her hands, she raised her eyes to heaven.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The minister went pale. This was too much.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Don't do that," he said, sharply, and lifted her to her feet almost roughly. Then
               he began speaking quickly,
               jerkily. 
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"It's no use, You do not—you <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">could</span> not—understand the real spirit of
               the religion. You would disgrace not only me, but the Mission work here. They will
               ask you all sorts of
               questions. They are only too glad to find a flaw in one's work and pull it to pieces
               over there. You would be an
               excellent card for them, and would
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="139"/>
               
               play into their hands. Why, you don't understand all it means. You can't go, Matsu.
               You mustn't."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"God-A'mighty!" they girl said, tragically; "whad I done?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He stared at her hopelessly.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Where did you learn that?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Thad 'God-A'mighty?'"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He nodded.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You!" She laughed triumphantly now.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I did not use it in that way," he said, flushing a dark red. But she nodded vehemently.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"<span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">Jus' like thad</span>—when you angery."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Angry?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Yes, with thad priest wot criticising you nize worg. 'Member? I hearing you like
               this," and she mocked him
               with exaggeration.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He frowned uncomfortably.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Tha's bad?" she questioned, demurely, peeping at him with her head cocked on one
               side.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"It isn't good," he said, shortly.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"So?" She was thoughtful a moment, and then: "Sa-ay, you nod sending me at America
               account I nod good? Well,
               also why you sending therefore you, you-ownself?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He stirred miserably under her accusing, quizzing eyes.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Oh, you're right," he said, disheartenedly, for he was out of sorts. "I don't amount
               to much, Matsu, and the
               fact is, I don't want to go; but I'm under marching orders, you see."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Marching orders? Say, why <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">you</span> don' putting <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">me</span> under them
               same marching orders?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She came round to the front of him and peered up into his face. Her head reached
               to his chin, and he was
               conscious that her hair was perfumed with a faint, subtle odor that was delightful.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Someone came swiftly up to them, and he heard the high, nasal voice of Miss Johnson
               from the Mission
               school.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Oh, Mr. Brandon, you are wanted. There's a meeting at eight, and they want you a
               little in advance—"
               She stopped short and stood staring at Matsu in speechless, suspicious horror.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Matsu! where did you get that dress? and why are you dressed like that?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The girl laughed defiantly, even as she retreated.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The gown was extravagantly beautiful and of the richest quality of silk. She smoothed
               it daintily and
               caressingly.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I geisha girl now," she declared, "an' I kin danze—so!" She executed a few steps.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Miss Johnson turned on the minister.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I knew it would come to this," she wailed, "after all these years. We might have
               expected it. She has been
               at her tricks again—deceiving dear, pure-minded Christian girls."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I nod tricking you," broke in Matsu, savagely. "Tha's nod wigged danzing. Tha's
               mos' nize of all. You thing
               I go worg ad thad factory gitting my hands all so dirty and sore? No; I <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">nod</span>!" she
               declared, passionately.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You could have followed some worthy trade. You could have even taken up the mission
               work, if it hadn't been
               for your wicked nature. And it was only last night Yuki told us that you had declared
               yourself converted."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	Matsu shrugged her shoulders fiercely. "I bagsliding!" she said. </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	The minister spole to her gently. "You would better come back with us for the present,"
               he said.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You taking me at that America?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"That is—impossible."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She turned quickly and ran down the hillside.</div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">	The preparations for the departure of the party went on slowly. Another girl and
               Yuki had been chosen to
               accompany the minister, and the unselfish workers at the Mission willingly made ready
               for them a comfortable
               little wardrobe that would stand them in good stead in America. The minister was ill
               at ease, and absentminded.
               Since the day when she had run away from them nothing had been seen of Matsu. The
               teachers
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="140"/>
               
               had unanimously agreed that she was really past redemption. No effort was made to
               find out her whereabouts; and,
               in fact, they one and all declared that it was, after all, just what they might have
               expected of her. They had
               had somewhat similar experience with all the half-caste children—they were unstable,
               unreliable, incapable
               of restraint. But the minister said little. He had acquired a habit of going down
               into the city after his work
               was finished and frequenting the different tea-gardens and dancing places. There was
               no sign of Matsu, and he
               worried so much over her loss that he grew thin and haggard from sleeplessness.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	It was a couple of nights before their departure that, as he was entering his house,
               he felt someone pull his
               coat tail, and, turning quickly, he encountered the sharp, defiant eyes of Matsu.
               He was so relieved and
               overjoyed at seeing her that he almost shouted. She clung to his hand as he drew her
               indoors.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Well, Matsu?" was what he said, after a moment, and then, as she seemed loath to
               speak, he prompted her:
               "Where have you been?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Me? Oh, jus' liddle bit visit."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Where?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Where? Let me see—"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Tell me the truth, Matsu."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She laughed hysterically.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I bin danzing," she said, drearily. </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"And don't you like it? Prefer the peaceful life here?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She caught her breath with a sob.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"I like go at America," she said.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Why?"</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She still tightly clasped his hand with both her small ones.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Ah, to be with you," she breathed.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	After that they stood in silence, and the minister closed his eyes. Her confession
               had startled his blood
               deliriously. No one in all his life had ever cared for him in that way before. The
               girl regarded him
               wistfully.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You got already 'nuder wife?" she inquired, anxiously; "mebbe two, three, 'leven,
               one hundred wifes?"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He shook his head, smiling faintly at her imagination, which was always so vivid.
               
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Why you nod marry with <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">me</span>, then?" she asked, and went closer to him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He put his two hands on her shoulders, and held her off.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Listen, Matsu, and look at me, too. See, I am years older than you are—past forty,
               in fact, and you a
               little girl of fifteen. Then, too, you are pretty, very pretty, Matsu, while I—well,
               you see, dear, I am a
               very plain, homely man—ugly, perhaps."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	She denied this vehemently.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"You mos' beautifulest gen'lemans in all the whole worl'."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	He laughed joyously.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Well, you're the only person who ever thought that, Matsu. In fact, I don't suppose
               anybody ever thought
               long enough about me to bother over that question. Then, too, I am poor, quite poor,
               with barely enough for
               independence, while <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">you</span>—remember that Jap fellow that used to haunt the Mission
               house, and you? What became of <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">him</span>, Matsu? <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">He</span> had money to
               burn, and, well, you know he came to me and wanted you for his wife; in fact, said
               he was willing to become a
               convert if I'd let him have you."
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Why he don' burn his ole money?" she asked, scornfully. "Me? I don' want."</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	They were silent for a moment after that, then the minister drew her a little closer
               to him. "You're too good
               for me, little girl," he said, looking down into her eyes. "There's nothing to <span data-el="hi" data-rend="italic">me</span>, in
               fact, except—"
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"Except?" she repeated.</div>
            
            <div data-el="p">	"That I love you, Matsu-san," he said, softly.</div>
