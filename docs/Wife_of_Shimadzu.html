            <div data-el="p">The Japanese consul smiled at the dyspeptic pathos
               manifest in the countenance of the little figure that had
               presented itself within his inner office. On the appealing
               features there were traced unmistakable lines of peculiar
               pain. Occasionally their momentary rigidity was disturbed by
               acute spasms.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Why, Narabara, what has put you to these honorable
               torments?” he asked.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The sufferer laid one hand on his little throbbing
               abdomen. “Excellency,” he moaned, “these very much august
               damn cooking too august for my insignificant stomach. It
               gives me too many honorable pains.” This with a grimace of
               the utmost anguish.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The consul had been rather long in the land of the august
               Americans—long enough to catch with grave Oriental
               diligence something of their humor. That, perhaps, was the
               reason he laughed, although the faces of his assistants, who
               had been a shorter time in the country, remained impassive
               and unamused at the sorrows of Narabara. Nothing of the
               consul's humor seemed to reach Narabara. Silently he awaited
               its conclusion. It was a common thing among these
               barbarians, and the consul—out of politeness, doubtless—
               did as they all did; for Narabara recalled that whenever he
               addressed an American on the subject, straightaway that
               honorable savage began to laugh.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Finally the amusement of the consul spent itself.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I thought,” he said, “that the honorable Narabara came to
               the land of the laughs to become one of the natives. I
               thought he desired to become an American. Did he not tell me
               that many Irish, themselves foreigners, came here and
               straightaway became Americans, and that he, too, a
               foreigner, was desirous of doing that also? Did he not ask
               me to find for him a typically American place of abode,
               where he might learn to eat of the dishes of this country,
               and did I not send him thither?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Godder dam!” responded Narabara, who failed to appreciate
               the consul's humor.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Come, tell me how you fared,” said the consul, pushing
               forward a chair hospitably and seating himself.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Ah, excellency,” said Narabara, sadly, “I went bravely to
               the honorable task. In the morning I arose and assassinated
               my unworthy stomach with a breakfast of a suspicious mush
               and the most honorable pig fried and mixed with hen egg. My
               inwards did make honorable rebellion at the tainting gnaw of
               pig flesh, but I tried to bear it. Then they brought
               suspicious cakes fried in grease over the living fire and
               things called biscuit, with all of which I struggled. Once
               they had honorable rice, but not cooked after our own divine
               manner; on the contrary, disfigured with raisins! In spite
               of my sufferings I persevered until their august Sunday,
               when they brought to the table a great, half-raw, malodorous
               flesh named 'roast beef.' It was a nightmare of Yedo! Sunday
               after Sunday came, and with it this stomach-revolting piece
               of flesh, which I was forced to eat, out of honorable
               politeness to the house. My soul longs and my stomach <span title="hun- gers" data-el="choice">
                  
                  hungers
                  </span> for the shiruko<a href="#n1" data-el="ref" data-target="#n1">[1]</a>, sushi, and the kamaboko of my
               fathers. My honorable insides are beset with the devils of
               pain. I come now to you as the representative of my people
               and the worthy friend of my father.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He doubled forward in his chair with an appealing bow.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The consul considered a moment.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You are in sore straits,” he said.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Direly afflicted,” answered Narabara.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “What can I do for you?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Narabara sighed.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Possibly,” he said, “there may be in this city of raw
               beef some of our countrymen, who, having tried the honorable
               dishes of these barbarians—”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Many, many such,” said the consul, thoughtfully.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Perhaps there are those who have given up the foolish
               fight and have made a place where we honorable exiles might
               partake of charvan, the namasu and the konomono. Is there no
               such Japanese restaurant here?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The consul turned to a type-written list on the wall.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “There is a Japanese restaurant at No. 10A West Forty-
               third street, kept by the worthy Shimadzu, where all those
               things are served,” he told Narabara. “I myself have eaten
               there. Go, then, to-night, to the house of Shimadzu.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               That night found Narabara seated in a corner of the
               restaurant of Shimadzu. The pains of his stomach seemed to
               have taken wings, for his face beamed blissfully.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Without, the house had presented every aspect of the
               conventional high-stooped residence of the type surrounding
               it. There was nothing, beyond the bamboo hangings at the
               windows, to differentiate it from its fellows, and these
               might pass in outside speculation as a manifestation of the
               taste of that species of millionaire prone to building
               European houses meant to be set in grounds on the crowded
               plot of a New York side street. There was not even a sign
               upon the house-front to denote its character. It was known
               only to the initiated and the elite of Manhattan Japanese
               society. Within, however, everything was Japanese.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When Narabara had ascended the little flight of stairs
               leading up from the street and had pushed open the unlatched
               door, he had come as near to gaping about as the polite
               Japanese may come. The partitions that had once separated
               the rooms of the residence had been removed, to make of the
               entire floor one immense chamber. Instead of bare, modern
               walls, sliding shoji (paper screens) marked the limits of
               the apartment. The whole interior was planned as the
               principal apartment of a Japanese house. Set against the
               walls were large jars and vases containing fresh flowers and
               excellent imitation sprays of cherry and plum blossoms.
               Attendants in native costume hurried hither and thither.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Narabara stood for a moment transfixed. Then he sighed—a
               long-drawn breath it was, that of a traveler returning home.
               Next he observed the bowing figure before him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Welcome,” said the figure, sonorously, “to the augustly
               insignificant and unworthy house of Shimadzu, most honorably
               condescending and august Narabara.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               With a slight inclination of the head Narabara
               acknowledged the other's salute.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You were expected,” continued the figure; “my master,
               Shimadzu, bade me escort you to an upper chamber, where your
               garment is in waiting.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After Narabara had changed his cumbersome American clothes
               for the soft, silken hakama which the attendant servilely
               offered, he was led to the principal apartment below. He was
               met at the door by the smiling consul, who led him to a
               table in a shaded corner of the room, introducing him to a
               number of men and women.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Ladies and gentlemen,” cried the consul, “let me present
               to you Narabara Shawtaro, an artist, who, after a gallant
               struggle with the dishes of his adopted land, has come again
               to his own.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="143"/>
               
               Narabara, after the buzz of salutations had died down,
               dared to glance stealthily under his eyes at these honorable
               ladies who were thus eating in public. He discovered, to his
               surprise, that while all the men at the table were Japanese,
               but one of the women bore even the slightest resemblance to
               his countrywomen, and even she had the rosy coloring of the
               West. Then he remembered that the consul had married an
               American. He glanced again at the girl beside him, and felt
               a strange glow of satisfaction in assuring himself that,
               despite her complexion, she was undoubtedly Japanese. At the
               other tables he saw that the diners were all Japanese, and
               he finally came to the conclusion that this little
               collection of friends at this particular table was a special
               party given by the consul.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “So you don't like American cooking?” said a voice beside
               him, and Narabara woke from his dream of delight.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Narabara soon found himself discussing charvan and
               American cooking with his companion. She spoke of Japanese
               cooking as one an enthusiast on things Japanese and a
               dweller in Nippon. When he was thoroughly at his ease, she
               allowed him to see that she was familiar with his flower
               paintings.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yours is not an ordinary brush. You do not copy nature as
               a photographer, but your brush seems to catch rather at the
               essence of the flower and depict its poetic significance,”
               she told him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Had she expressed this sentiment in English, Narabara
               would have muttered his polite, “Certainly, certainly,”
               signifying that he did not understand; but she spoke in
               Japanese. The artist glowed. When the meal was over Narabara
               thought her the most intelligent woman he had ever met. He
               had just begun to think her the most beautiful woman he had
               ever seen, when she said:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Perhaps you have puzzled over my nationality. I am only
               half Japanese. My mother was of Nippon and my father in the
               English consular service.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               After a moment she added, as if to relieve the somewhat
               embarrassing silence:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I am sure you are going to like this place. I often come
               here myself, not only because of the food, but because of
               other things. Sometimes they have—ah, now you shall see for
               yourself.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               At a sign from Shimadzu the remnants of the feast—for, in
               spite of the Japanese prevalence of fish in all forms, it
               had been designed as a banquet—were swept away. The lights,
               save a few in the rear of the room, were extinguished,
               leaving the apartment in partial gloom. The chatter and
               laughter of the guests died away as these apparent
               preparations for something to come were made. Then, into the
               softened darkness, there came—pulsating, vibrating—the
               weird drone and squeak of the samisen<a href="#n2" data-el="ref" data-target="#n2">[2]</a> rising and mingling
               in a movement that suggested the passing away, the gliding
               of all things. A shoji in the rear, somewhat distant from
               the diners, slid back, disclosing a Japanese expanse of land
               and water, with a mountain rising in the background, the
               regretful rays of a dying sun bathing it in a golden light.
               The scene remained but a moment, and then vanished to make
               room for another as strangely beautiful. When the lights
               came again, Narabara found his companion sitting with her
               hands to her eyes.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I thought I was in the city of my birth,” she said.
            </div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p"></div>
            
            
            <div data-el="p">From that night forth Narabara was to be found every
               evening at the house of Shimadzu. Sometimes he came alone,
               often with friends; but he always sat in the same place and
               the identical corner where he had met the Eurasian. His
               constant occupation of the place attracted no notice, for
               each of the patrons of Shimadzu had his own seat and his own
               table where he was regularly to be found. And no one thought
               of taking the place or the table of an old patron. So the
               artist's spot came to be known as “Narabara's corner.”

            <div data-el="p">
               Narabara had been a regular <span title="at- tendant" data-el="choice">
                  
                  attendant
                  </span> at the house of Shimadzu for some months when, one
               evening, on ladies' night, he entered the place with the
               young half-barbarian, whose name, she had told him, was
               Otama Wallace. They went straightaway to his accustomed
               corner. Narabara wanted to be alone with her that evening.
               Perhaps the girl guessed what was in his mind, and she could
               not blame him for taking advantage of her mood in bringing
               her where the Japanese atmosphere affected her always so
               deeply.

               Their meal was begun in a silence that was eloquent.
               Narabara had hardly found his voice when Shimadzu was seen
               coming toward them. He smiled blandly on them.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Excellency,” he said, “pardon this unworthy forwardness
               of an insignificant man, but who is yet happy.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes?” they smiled, appreciatively.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Shimadzu, encouraged, continued:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I am happy as a nightingale, and blessed am I in my
               insignificance.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The girl made answer:
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “O Shimadzu, maker of the finest kamaboko, tell us the
               cause of thy honorable joy.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It is,” said Shimadzu, “because I am about to make an
               honorable alliance with Madame Kiku, who at present resides
               in San Francisco. She will come soon to preside over my
               insignificant establishment in an august manner.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               When he had received their congratulations he went from
               table to table, announcing his projected marriage with a
               beaming face. After he was gone, Narabara looked shyly at
               the half-foreign face of his friend. He could see, from her
               shining eyes and flushed cheeks, that the announcement of
               Shimadzu had pleased and excited her. She had all a woman's
               interest in a romance.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “The best part of your nature,” said Narabara, “is
               Japanese.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “It is so,” she answered; “the best part of me is
               Japanese; but—” she hesitated a moment—“still, I am not
               Japanese.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I love you,” said Narabara, his courage taking sudden
               fire; “if you will marry me you will be wholly Japanese.”
               The girl looked at him reflectively.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Just now,” he continued, with a pleading quality in his
               voice, “you said the better part of you was Japanese. Why
               not marry me, then? I am not uncivilized, though I cannot
               American dishes. Our marriage shall be the union of art with-
               -with—” he glanced at her brilliant coloring—“with the
               spirit of poetry.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Oh, Narabara!” she cried, leaning toward him impulsively,
               “you don't know what you are asking. It is true that I am
               more Japanese than anything else, though I have lived the
               best part of my life here; but, after all, I am only a half-
               caste. In Japan I would be scorned; even here I am regarded
               as a curiosity.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “But you have not answered me,” said Narabara. “You do not
               refuse me?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “No, I do not. Ask me in a month's time. I cannot answer
               you to-night, for I feel that, while my better part is
               Japanese, I must do my Saxon half justice. Tonight—this
               place—you—Japan herself is on my nerves. Ask me in a
               month, when I can see things more clearly.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Long after the girl had gone to her home in a carriage,
               Narabara sat in his accustomed corner brooding over coming
               events, with the aid of sake and the weird music of the
               place.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The time passed rapidly for Narabara. He had been much
               engaged with his art work, for Narabara had become the fad
               in certain circles, and many orders had come to him. A
               number of times he had attempted to see Miss Wallace, but
               without success. He had penetrated as far as the reception
               room of the thoroughly Saxon apartment-house of his
               mistress. She would dine with him at the house of Shimadzu
               at the end of the period she had mentioned, and would then
               come to a decision, was the word brought to him by the man.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then the wife of Shimadzu had arrived. Narabara had cause
               to <span title="re- member" data-el="choice">
                  
                  remember
                  </span> vividly her first appearance in his favorite house of
               entertainment. It had been an occasion of much preparation.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               All of the most distinguished and the oldest patrons of
               the house of Shimadzu had taken great care to be present. A
               sumptuous feast had been made ready, and each patron was in
               his accustomed place, when the silken hangings of a seldom-
               used entrance parted and Shimadzu appeared, leading by the
               hand a diminutive figure. She wore a kimono of dove-gray
               silk, tied about with a purple obi<a href="#n3" data-el="ref" data-target="#n3">[3]</a>. Her hair was done high
               on her head and spread out like a fan in the butterfly mode
               of coiffure. Altogether, she presented a bewitching
               appearance. Extending her arms, like the wings of a bird, in
               a semicircle that began at the waist, reaching an arm's
               length away, she prostrated herself before the company, her
               forehead touching the floor. A murmur of admiration and
               approval went up from the assemblage. The guests, rising
               from their chairs, bowed profoundly before her. A moment
               later the little figure, raising itself from the floor,
               stood proudly erect. There was not a trace of embarrassment
               on her face. In fact, she hurried forward with the air of a
               business woman, crossed to a chair that had been twisted out
               of position to suit the whim of an old patron, in whose
               settled nook it stood, and set it back against the table.
               The company watched the movements of the bride curiously.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “That should be so,” she said to her husband, in excellent
               English.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Shimadzu delightedly explained to his guests that in San
               Francisco she had catered to English customers; and, he
               added, she had had the finest trade on the Pacific coast.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Within a comparatively few hours the entire policy and
               management of the house of Shimadzu were altered. The day
               following the advent of the wife of Shimadzu a glaring
               advertisement appeared in the newspapers soliciting the
               trade of American patrons. Outside the door of the
               restaurant a poster announced that Madame Shimadzu had taken
               charge of the place and was now ready to receive customers.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               From that time forward the hospitable Japanese precincts
               hitherto reserved exclusively for sons of Nippon became the
               stamping-ground of that class which, drinking unknown wines
               in foreign show restaurants, calls itself “bohemian.”
               Writers who had gained a certain short vogue, accompanied by
               actresses, were to be found in profusion. And curiously
               enough the place was known to these no longer as the house
               of Shimadzu, but “that cute little place of Madame
               Chrysanthemum's.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Before this peroxide invasion, the guests of Shimadzu—the
               Japanese guests—melted away. A few of them out of old-time
               loyalty still continued to visit the place, but only out of
               loyalty. To remain, they were compelled to battle constantly
               with Madame Shimadzu, whose management of the restaurant's
               interior set at variance all traditions. The nooks and
               corners, hitherto occupied for years by this or that
               Japanese dignitary, were either utterly eliminated or were
               so altered that their former owners no longer recognized
               them. To the apathetic Shimadzu the old patrons went.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “May it please you,” they complained, “your honorable wife
               has so altered the appearance of your honorable house that
               we no longer recognize our insignificant selves.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Shimadzu shrugged a fat shoulder, something he had not
               done prior to his marriage.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Pray complain to Madame Shimadzu,” he said; “she augustly
               runs my insignificant house.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Madame Shimadzu had been so spoiled by the flattery that
               had always been her due that at the first question of her
               authority her temper burst out on the unfortunate Japanese
               gentlemen who had ventured to complain, the chief of whom
               was Narabara. Thereafter he was an object of especial
               dislike to her, and she took a malicious pleasure
               
               
               <hr data-el="pb" data-n="146"/>
               
               in making him as uncomfortable as possible, never allowing
               the opportunity to escape her of venting her spleen on him.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Meanwhile, the month of suspense allotted to Narabara by
               Miss Wallace came to a conclusion. Narabara, with a
               carriage, waited on her during one of those nights that had
               been celebrated formerly in the house of Shimadzu as
               “ladies' days.” Enough Japanese were still present in the
               restaurant on their arrival to make their wearing of
               Japanese costume not a subject of uncomfortable remark.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “How changed everything is!” the girl exclaimed to
               Narabara, as they were seated in the corner of the new
               arrangement as near as possible to that once occupied by
               Narabara.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The girl's first mood of disappointment wore off as the
               meal and the evening progressed. The leaping forth of the
               music wisely retained by Madame Shimadzu brought back the
               old light to the girl's eyes. Madame Shimadzu herself was
               nowhere to be seen.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Yes, my dear Narabara,” the girl told the artist as they
               sat listening to the music, “I feel all Japanese tonight.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The kimono she wore set off her Oriental blood. She looked
               unmistakably Japanese this night.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You will marry me?” the artist breathed forth.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “I think I—” began the girl.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The quick eye of Madame Shimadzu as she entered identified
               at once the feature traits of the Eurasian manifest in the
               young girl at Narabara's side. It was a mixture of blood she
               despised. Angrily she crossed to Narabara's table. Just as
               the young girl was about to answer Narabara, Madame Shimadzu
               blazed out at her, regardless of the numerous company in the
               crowded supper-room.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Despicable woman,” she cried, with the bitterest
               vindictiveness, “out of my house!”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The company stared. As the insult left the lips of Madame
               Shimadzu, Miss Wallace started hastily to her feet. She
               spoke in a hard, tense voice to Narabara.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “You see what your race is, how they regard me. No! I
               thank heaven I am not entirely pagan myself. I certainly
               shall not marry you.”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then, without waiting to slip off the kimono she wore, the
               girl passed quickly to her carriage and was driven away
               before the astounded Narabara could offer to conduct her
               thither.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Two evenings later there was open, violent revolt in the
               house of Shimadzu, led by Narabara. The old patrons, under
               the vigorous direction of the artist, met in grave, earnest,
               and serious conclave. Everything was done in order. First,
               the grievances of each member were set forth at voluminous
               length in Japanese hieroglyphics. Then a remedy was
               discussed and an ultimatum framed for Shimadzu. A deputation
               appointed from this conference waited on Shimadzu, carrying
               several rolls of parchment. They were little, yellow-faced
               men, but they were in earnest.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Shimadzu, your honorable house has become an offense and
               an abomination to all good sons of Nippon,” said Narabara,
               the spokesman. “The old places where we long sat, which were
               hallowed to us because of the dreams dreamed there, are no
               more. The shoji of this place are no longer visible to the
               eye of Japanese gentlemen alone. Honorable barbarians are
               permitted to enter at will. They are a curse, and they taint
               the air—”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               The spokesman paused. Shimadzu rolled his eyes lazily.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “But my wife, she do all that; tell her,” he objected.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “True, your wife has done this. It is of her we should
               speak,” went on Narabara.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               He paused ominously.
            </div>

               “If you refuse, your name shall be branded throughout all
               Nippon as an unworthy son, as one who, keeping an orderly
               house, has made it an offense to his countrymen; as one who,
               having made a home for exiles, has turned them out.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “No, no!” said Shimadzu.

               “If you refuse, thirty devout Japanese gentlemen shall

            <div data-el="p">
               “No, no!” Shimadzu groaned, cringing and doubling over.

            <div data-el="p">
               “I would consent, gentlemen,” he added, “but how can it be

            <div data-el="p">
               “It can readily be managed,” relentlessly continued
               Narabara; “do as in Nippon. Announce to the woman that you
               have divorced her. Give her her passage money and such dowry
               as you may choose, and let her return to that Western city
               which can spare her but ill.”

            <div data-el="p">
               “It shall be done,” said Shimadzu.

            <div data-el="p">When next Miss Wallace, in response to the fervid appeals
               of Narabara, visited the house of Shimadzu, all was as
               before. The serpent had departed from their Eden. Old
               patrons were in their former places. All was restored, and
               the “bohemians” were rigidly turned away at the door, to
               their complete disgust and bewilderment. Only Japanese and
               the women brought by them and their friends were allowed to
               enter the place. The sign was gone from the front of the
               house. The advertisement had disappeared from the
               newspapers.

            <div data-el="p">
               At first Narabara's guest was constrained and distant.
               Hers was a sensitive soul, and she had been deeply wounded.
               But as each event of the evening reassured her, her mood
               softened. When at the meal's close the shoji rolled back,
               disclosing the old pictures of Japan she had loved, she
               uttered a cry of joy. Narabara thought his time had come.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Shimadzu divorce his wife,” he remarked, generally.

            <div data-el="p">
               “Divorced his wife!” she exclaimed. “Why, how could he do
               that?”
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               Then Narabara shrugged expressive shoulders.

            <div data-el="p">
               “All the same thing—he send her away,” he said, simply.
            </div>
            
            <div data-el="p">
               “Well, what if he has?” she asked.

            <div data-el="p">
               “We make him do it, partly because she change everything
               and have vicious temper, most because she insult you. Now
               will you marry me?”

            <div data-el="p">
               The girl laughed a trifle hysterically. Then, her eyes
               shining with tears in the semi-darkness of the room, she
               laid her hand impulsively on his.
