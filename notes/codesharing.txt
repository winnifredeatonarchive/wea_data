Initial codesharing plan ideas:

* Generate a TEI page for every element that lists all of its examples as egXMLs (with unique @xml:ids)
* Also create an index of that parent and its <egXML>s (i.e <ptr type="parents" target="file.xml#a file.xml#b file2.xml#c/>)
* And then create these XHTML page fragments (i.e. abbr.html, add.html)
* If you've clicked show me these things, then just grab the content of the file (or the first ten, say) and put them into
  the document
* If you've clicked show me these things, but wrap them in their parent, do a bit more work:
  ** Tokenize the list of target and files
  ** From 1 to n, take each target and get those examples and put them into the page
  ** And then highlight the element, of course.
  ** [Do we have a list of "stop-elements"? I.e. if
