            <p>The Sun-goddess had spread wide her arms and had taken
the whole land into her embrace. So dazzling and joyous was
her smile that Yonejiro Nishimura found the courage at last
to defy the august will of his honorable parents and to
secretly wed the maiden Matsuba.</p>
            <p>
     A little, garrulous nakoda<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> had rushed pellmell to the
Nishimura castle, and between his catchings for breath and
his perpetual kow-towings and bobbings he had told the
haughty lord and his haughtier lady of the mésalliance of
their only son. An hour later Yonejiro with his girl bride
was turned away at the gates of the castle.</p>
            <p>
     The young husband patted the little, tremulous hand
that clung to his arm.</p>
            <p>
     “This love of ours,” said he, “will atone for the
displeasure of a million ancestors.”</p>
            <p>
     “Yes,” said the girl hopefully, “and, if we are
deserving, perhaps

the great Goddess of Mercy will bless us in a year with a
man-child!”</p>
            <p>
     A shadow passed over the boy's face.</p>
            <p>
     “Psh! That is an honorably ancient ambition, Matsuba-
san. I want no child to take thee from me,” he said.</p>
            <p>
     “But,” protested Matsuba, “if the gods blessed me with
a man-child—a son—why then the august parents would surely
forgive us.”</p>
            <p>
     “I desire not their forgiveness,” returned the boy
proudly. “Listen, Matsuba-san. Last night the little yellow
moon dropped down right to my window and crept in close to
my heart. I could feel its warm, loving embrace against me.
But gradually it began to drift from me further and further
and further away, until it was nothing but a pale beam that
I could only stretch out my hands toward and yearn to reach
and hold, but could not. And I thought that thou wert the
honorable moon, that had come to my heart to abide but a
moment and then to leave me.”</p>
            <p>
     “Beloved,” she said softly, “I, too, had a strange
dream. I thought that this dread Spirit of Death crept upon
me with stealing step. But I dreamed also that the divine
Goddess of Mercy had pity on us both, and while thou
stretched out thy hands to hold me, a flower, strong and
beautiful and shapely, grew up between us and joined our
hearts once more in a union that no death could sever.”</p>
            <p>
     “Let us go to the old priest at the Temple Zuiganji,”
said the boy fearfully; “perhaps he can tell us the meaning
of our honorable dreams.”</p>
            <p>
     In the dazzling light and warmth of the sun-smile these
two children, hand in hand, sought the temple.</p>
            <p>
     “Wear this honorable amulet, which contains a sacred
seed, about thy neck,” said the priest; “the gods will bless
you.”</p>
            <p>
     “Promise me,” said the girl later, laying his hands to
her heart, “that if the Spirit of Death shall touch me, then
thou wilt take this frail body of mine, cremate it to ashes,
and in my ashes thou wilt plant the seed within this sacred
amulet which the good priest has blessed. When a flower
shall come to life out of my ashes, then will I return to
thee. Promise, Yonejiro-sama.”</p>
            <p>
     “I swear!” said the youth solemnly.</p>

                          <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>

            <p>The months sped by on airy wing.</p>
            <p>
     “Such months of joy!” sighed the girl, leaning back
against his arm. Suddenly she straightened up, and, putting
her hands on his shoulders, she looked bravely into his
eyes.</p>
            <p>
     “But this is the day,” she said, “when thou must go to
the honorable parents and tell the great news that will win
their honorable forgiveness and that of all thy august
ancestors.”</p>
                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>
            <p>Up in the great castle the honorable parents received
the news stoically.</p>
            <p>
     The Lady Nishimura spoke in a stately whisper to her
lord:</p>
            <p>
     “An' it be a son?”</p>
            <p>
     “She will have earned a place in our noble household,”
returned her husband, with an inward hope.</p>
            <p>
     “A daughter?”</p>
            <p>
     “They have marked their own destiny,” he returned
coldly.</p>
            <p>
     With deep and graceful obeisances the boy made his
farewells and travelled back to his humble abode.</p>
            <p>
     On the road his parents overtook him.</p>
            <p>
     On the threshold of his house a wailing servant flung
herself at his feet, and, doubling over, beat her head
there. He pushed her aside and strode within.</p>
            <p>
     They had dressed her in all vestal white, pure but
ghastly. The Spirit of Death had kissed her gently,
tenderly.</p>

            <pb n="606"/>

            <p>Said the honorable mother to her lord:</p>
            <p>
     “The gods are very good.”</p>
            <p>
     His lordship raised high his brows.</p>
            <p>
     “They have taken her, this peasant girl, from our noble
household,” went on the lady.</p>
            <p>
     She evidently was pleased.</p>
            <p>
     “Ah,” said Lord Nishimura, smacking his lips with
satisfaction, “and left a man-child to uphold our noble
ancestry and to save our mighty race from extinction!”</p>
            <p>
     A sobbing moon, behind a veil of clouds, peered out
upon a winding highway. A desolate pilgrim, carrying under
his hakama<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> a small lacquer box, tightly sealed.</p>
            <p>
     Years passed away. The great Lord Nishimura and his
lady wife joined their countless noble ancestors.</p>
            <p>
     Yonejiro, the heir to the title and estates, came back
to his ancestral home an old man. With the immense sum of
money obtained from the disposal of the estates he purchased
all the land within three hundred acres surrounding the
little cottage wherein the gentle spirit of his girl bride
had lived and died. On this site and adjoining the cottage
he built a noble shrine to her memory, surpassing in
grandeur the tombs of his feudal ancestors. He then shaved
clean his head, changed his garments to robes of flowing
white, and became a priest of the most rigid and retired
order.</p>
            <p>
     His shrine was of a peculiar order and unlike that of
any other known in Japan. One stately image alone sat upon a
golden pedestal—Kwannon, the Goddess of Mercy, with the
halo of the moon about her head, clothed only in the veil of
her midnight hair, and with an expression of divine pity on
her face as she bent over and blessed a little lacquer pot
within which reposed the ashes of the bride of Yonejiro and
the sacred seed blessed by the priest of the Zuiganji
Temple.</p>
            <p>
     Years ago Yonejiro discovered that the dust in the box
had moved; the following day his sharpened eye noted a
little mound in the centre. In seven days' time one small
green speck peeped out of the mound. With the passing of the
days the speck enlarged, deepened its hue of green, spread
out into thin but tangible leaves, grew in stature and in
shape. One day when Yonejiro came into the darkened temple
to softly spray the plant with subtly-perfumed water drawn
from a well of sweetest water, he found a strange and
shapely blossom had spring into life out of the plant.</p>
            <p>
     Softly and reverently he knelt before it. And while he
knelt a strange thing happened. The doors of the temple were
frantically thrown open and one entered with a little cry of
fear and rushed headlong across the temple toward him,
caught his robe affrightedly and crouched trembling at his
feet.</p>
            <p>
     The priest laid his hand reassuringly on her head.</p>
            <p>
     “Thou art safe here in this sacred temple,” he said
gently. “Pray speak thy trouble to me. I am a priest of the
divine Goddess of Mercy. How can I serve thee?”</p>
            <p>
     With her face still hidden in the folds of his gown,
the girl began to speak in a strangled whisper.</p>
            <p>
     “I am called Haru, the dancer. My master is Omi of the
Sanzaeyemon Gardens in Yedo. At a fête to the moon I did
please the fancy of the wicked Marquis Takahashi, to whom my
master Omi has sold me for five hundred yen. I have fled
from the city, and know not what paths I have followed or
whither I have journeyed. They have followed my trail as the
eagle its prey. Listen! Dost hear the sound of their
shouting beyond thy lands? Oh, I pray thee, hide me and save
me<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> in thy sacred temple!”</p>
            <p>
     The priest hesitated. The girl crept nearer to him on
her knees, until her head came close on a level

<pb n="607"/>

with the strange flower in the lacquer box, over which a
lighted censer swung back and forth. The light from the
censer broadened and spread and gathered into its halo with
the flower the girl's upturned face.</p>
            <p>
     A great upheaval shook the soul of Yonejiro, the
priest.</p>
            <p>
     “Anata!<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>”</p>
            <p>The girl's eyes had become transfixed on the flower.
Slowly he turned back the bosom of her silken kimono. Just
below her long, slim throat Yonejiro saw the same strange
flower, as it were stamped indelibly upon her breast.</p>
            <p>
     “Ah!” said the priest softly, “thou hast come back to
me at last!”</p>
