            <p>The Japanese of New York make a small but energetic and
ambitious colony, approximating a thousand, of which only
thirty are women.</p>
            <p>
     There is not a great diversity in the employments they
follow. Apart from the merchants and importers, men in the
consular service, a few writers and three or four artists,
the average Japanese in Manhattan is either a clerk or
domestic servant. Of course there are also a number of
students attending the colleges here, but even among these,
one may find youths employed as above, using their meager
earnings to defray their college expenses. Besides these,
there are a number of men of leisure who have literally made
New York their home. I believe there is only one lecturer in
the colony, and it might also include a transient group of
jugglers, who like most vaudeville players, make New York
their headquarters.</p>
            <p>
     I make no defense of the ambition that causes one to
cross thousands and thousands of miles of land and water to
come to a strange and alien country for the pitiful
employment of domestic service in a foreigner's household.
There are not many Americans who would do this. Still, there
is something admirable in the spirit behind it, which, after
all, is superior to the pride scorning such employment. Many
of the Japanese who come to New York are bitterly poor. It
is an old delusion that the average student here is sent by
the generous Japanese government. On the contrary, most of
the young Japanese men in New York have come on their own
account to satisfy their native curiosity and thirst for
more knowledge of the great and fascinating West. How many
of

<pb n="52"/>

these youths arrive utterly penniless and friendless! But
having reached the land of desire, they must at once “study
the country.” For this, time and money are required: the
former they have; the latter they must obtain at once in
order to exist. And so they go to work--the easiest work to
obtain. They make excellent butlers, valets and cooks. They
are both clean and dignified—excellent traits in a servant.</p>
            <p>
     It is told of the Marquis Ito that when a youth he
wandered about the streets of London, penniless, ragged and
hungry, a starving alien in a strange land. No employment
was too lowly for that one whose eager and ambitious mind
was in after years to point out to the civilized world a new
sun of astonishing brightness arisen in the East.</p>
            <p>
     That the Japanese merchants and men of means appreciate
the real spirit which has brought their poorer countrymen to
New York is shown by the really beautiful beneficence of
these men. Many of them are private benefactors on a most
unexpected scale, as is shown in the case of three tea
merchants who have imported to this country a number of
Japanese youths and are personally paying for their
education and living. Besides this, the number of their
proteges among the clerks and artisans is astonishing.</p>
            <p>
     But it is not all striving, aspiring and working among
the Japanese of New York. On the contrary they are quite a
gay and happy little colony. They have their clubs, their
societies, small social circles and gatherings. There is one
small club whose members meet to practice their national
jiujutsu, a scientific method of wrestling and boxing quite
unsurpassed in the West. There is much mystery, too, about
this jiujutsu, and the members are under a rigid oath to
reveal none of the various secrets of this ancient cult.</p>
            <p>
     The Hinode, or Rising Sun Club, is the foremost and
most exclusive social organization in the city. It was
founded in 1896. Its members are for the most part men of
leisure, merchants, importers, students, writers and
artists. The pleasures and sports enjoyed by this
organization are strikingly American—yachting, excursions,
tennis, golf, bowling, billiards, and even card-playing. The
Club prides itself upon its Americanism, though in reality
beneath its western surface it is essentially Japanese. The
influence of “Dai Nippon”<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> is upon every individual member.
This may account for the fact that not one of its members
has become a naturalized citizen of this country. The heart
and nature beneath the American clothes are still Japanese.</p>
            <p>
     A number of the Japanese have married American women
and the latter affiliate quite freely with the Japanese
colony. There are very few half-castes in New York, and most
of these are children. They are regarded here with far more
toleration and even cordiality by the Japanese than they
would be in Japan. This is doubtless because of the fact
that after all a good many of the Japanese here are in favor
of mixed marriages and cherish the desire to marry a western
woman; so that their own offspring may be of that same
mixture of blood formerly despised in far away Japan, that
is, the Eurasian.</p>
            <p>
     Lafcadio Hearn holds that the Japanese have the
greatest patriotism. It

<pb n="53"/>

is true, to the point of fanaticism. Right here in New York
that almost religious love for the fatherland is constantly
shown. Whenever any matter of national import to Japan is
brought to a crisis, then the little band of Japanese in New
York is simply aflutter with excitement. The colony is well
informed concerning all the political movements of its
distant home, and every bit of triumph, diplomatic or
otherwise, attained by their country is exultantly
celebrated by the exiles in Manhattan. When the several
nations of the world were battering the walls of Peking, and
little Japan plunged in bantam-like for her share of martial
honor, few knew that the Japanese in New York celebrated the
occasion by a banquet given at Sherry's. With tears in their
eyes they hoarsely sang the national anthem and with equal
fervor the Star-Spangled Banner.</p>
            <p>
     The Japanese of New York are a somewhat serious and
even solemn appearing little band. There is not a strong
enough sense of humor among them to appreciate some of the
very humorous experiences they meet in New York.
Consequently, these very experiences often take on, to them,
the aspect of tragedy.</p>
            <p>
     For instance, there is a small but handsome Japanese
gentleman in New York who is a sentimentalist by nature. As
he is rich, cultured and very entertaining, he is a great
favorite

<pb n="54"/>

within a circle of Americans. He is always in love with some
impossible woman and his amours are the joke of his
countrymen and the despair of his own heart. Unfortunately,
he has a wife and a number of babies at home in Japan. A New
York lawyer has advised him that he cannot also legally
marry an American woman. Nothing would induce him to divorce
his Japanese wife, of whom he is very fond, but he simply
cannot resist the charms of the women of this country. He is
rich enough to retire to his Japan, but he lingers on here.
Among his American acquaintances he is thought to be a
bachelor.</p>
            <p>
     The Japanese who have the oddest experiences in New
York are those who endeavor to become very American, and
consequently seek to make New York friends. Of a dignified,
sensitive temperament, the Japanese is constantly having his
amour propre pierced in consequence. Often, to his intense
indignation, he finds himself, instead of the respected
guest, the object of amusement and entertainment to his
American hosts. This is often involuntary on the part of the
latter, and in justice to them, there are only a few after
all who invite Mr. Japan “because he is sure to amuse
everybody else there.” The absurd mistakes made by the
hapless Japanese new to American ways are usually the cause
of the latter’s mirth. Take, for instance, the case of a
young Japanese gentleman of high birth and very elegant
manners. He was entertained by a charming New York woman who
really was flattered and pleased to have him as her guest
and had invited a number of distinguished friends to meet
him. All went well until dinner time. Then the previously
flattered Japanese suddenly found himself the object of the
most unexpected mirth, stifled and suppressed when possible,
but undeniably there. To laugh at a Japanese gentleman of
dignity is a deadly affront and insult, and the paleness of
the guest was not wholly due to the barbarous food he had
swallowed. True to the tradition of his own race, this
gentleman, out of compliment to his hostess, had eaten all
placed before him. Food in America is not always served in
the dainty small courses with which the Japanese are
familiar, and so the action of this guest was quite heroic.
He ate everything before him and everything handed to him,
even to a full plate of hot and spicy chow-chow, from which
he was only expected to help himself to a portion. Having
swallowed this chow-chow and vainly endeavoring to stifle a
choking cough, he declared to his hostess that that food was
“most hot stuff,” a remark which sent the table into
convulsions.</p>
            <p>
     New York has among its Japanese colony a fair number of
clever artists, humorists and writers. The latter contribute
to a little magazine published here called “Japan and
America.” It is published and written in the English
language, but its editors and general staff and contributors
are all Japanese.</p>
            <p>
     The colony has, too, one poet—one lone poet. His muse
finds its inspiration in the English tongue—and sometimes
it distorts the language grotesquely. But the poet is a poet
for a' that. He says he would rather be a poet by nature
than write poetry. So he can humor his fancies to his
heart's content. And his fancies are eccentric. When he
likes a person he is apt to send him poems over the
telegraph wires, and when he dislikes one he is

<pb n="55"/>

sure to tell one so. He has big brown eyes, very sad and
mysterious in expression. His hair is long and straight and
silky, and he “looks the part.”</p>
            <p>
     Then there is a modern Japanese artist in the colony.
By that I mean one who has deliberately abandoned all the
ideals of his countrymen in regard to art. Then he studied
art in America. He is one of those Japanese who are
complimented if you take them by mistake for Frenchmen.</p>
            <p>
     While picking out the various characters of distinction
in the colony, I must not forget a Japanese-German. He is
the son of a German nobleman by a Japanese wife. There is no
question of his genius—and indeed he is a genius in more
ways than one, the very reason, perhaps, of his failure to
win the highest laurels. He writes exquisitely, both in
German and in English. His little stories are prose poems.
No words could be more happily used than he uses them in his
writing. He is also a clever artist, a book and art critic,
and besides all this, a perfume entertainer. In short, he
has invented a novel device of entertainment; one, however,
which only the truly aesthetic could enjoy and appreciate.
His invention is a device for diffusing perfumes of various
sorts throughout a concert hall. He lectures on a trip to
Japan. His audience is taken by him verbally to the various
countries at which they wish to stop before reaching Japan.
Starting from America with the hall all odorous of American
beauties, he changes the perfume at each stopping place
until Japan, with her trees of cherry, is reached and
smelled. Sad to relate, the only occasion upon which this
versatile man gave his lecture, a stupid manager arranged
his “attraction” for a beer garden. It is needless to say
that the noses of the placidly smoking and drinking patrons
were not sufficiently aesthetic to smell the point of the
lecture.</p>
            <p>
     Every once in a while one drifts across some little
waif of Japan in this city, who seems somehow cut off and
separated, not only from the Americans, but his own people.
I ran after a Japanese lad I saw turned away from an
elevator in a building, bearing that edifying motto—“No
canvassers, dogs or beggars admitted.” The boy had a basket
of lily bulbs. He was thin and weary looking, his face white
and pinched, and his hands were blue with cold. I was
fabulously rich that day (having disposed of a story to a
magazine), and I “went shares” with the lily boy.</p>
            <p>
     In Coney Island, once I came across a real Jap-Yankee.
He was crying his wares in a voice which drowned out a
Hebrew rival's, and his hand swung back and forth a
mechanical American balloon, blown into the form of a pig.
Here was enterprise for you!</p>
