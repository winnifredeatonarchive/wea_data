            <head>The Life of a Japanese Girl</head>


            <p>The first lesson instilled into the mind of a Japanese

girl is to be modest and gentle, and she is reared along

lines which tend to make her respect her elders.<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> From the

days when she is wrapped in long clothes to the time when

she is given to her bridegroom she is under the strict

though gentle care of her parents. Though constantly

disciplined, it is in so mild and gentle and unseen yet firm

a way that maidenhood becomes a pleasure and wifehood a joy.

Out of all this there grows the love of and devotion to her

parents that is beautiful.</p>
            <p>

     The Christian parents in Japan dedicate their little

girls to God, and take care of them in their early life,

just the same as in Christendom. But the Buddhist parents

dedicate them to their gods, attending the main temples,

where the patron gods of their families are supposed to be

placed. They are named seven days after their birth.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>Japanese girls to-day enjoy much greater freedom and

liberty than before the great revolution of the government

system. Previous to that time there had been distinct

classes of people in Japan, and the classes were forbidden,

under pain of punishment, to intermingle. It was only the

higher classes who enjoyed the opportunities of advanced

education and had chances for development; but in these days

all classes have equal rights.</p>
            <p>

     A mother who has a great many children generally sends

the new-born babe out to be nursed, no matter whether it be

girl or boy, and the nurse has entire charge of it from two

to seven or eight years. If she does not send the baby out,

she hires a girl to take care of it.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>Even when she is only a very little girl, her mother is

anxious to try her ability in talking. She will very soon

learn how to say “haha” (mamma), “toto”
(papa). Soon the

mother will teach her how to sit politely on the floor. The

Japanese floor is, however, not at all like the American

floor, or that of other countries. It is three or four feet

from the ground at least, and there are mats over it

thickened about four inches with soft rice straw, stuffing

the outside cover, which is changed every summer. She is

taught how to eat her meals correctly; how to speak politely

and grammatically. When she goes out to play, she is

forbidden to run around too much or to play rough games like

the boys. The home part of her education is to teach her how

to be modest, meek, and polite. When she is six years of age

she must attend the common school to take the primary course

of study, compulsory education extending over all the

country. She first studies morals, reading, writing,

arithmetic, geography, music and drawing. She spends four

years in the common school, and if she can afford it, goes

to a higher common school. There she studies sewing,

arithmetic, reading, physiology, physical geography,

history, and all other branches necessary for every-day

life. The school system in Japan to-day is pretty much the

same for girls as it is for boys. Science, history,

mathematics, and very often Chinese classics are necessary,

but the morals are considered by far the most important

branch of female education in Japan.</p>
            <p>

     Physical exercise is greatly encouraged in the schools.

The girls play basket ball, croquet, and even lawn tennis

outdoors, and practice with dumb-bells and Indian clubs.

After remaining four years in the second course in the

higher common school, at the age of fourteen, if the girl

can afford it, she is sent to a still higher school to

pursue her special studies. If a girl is very ambitious, she

can enter the imperial universities for degrees.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>There are various religions in Japan.</p>
            <p>

     As stated before, Japanese Christian parents bring

their little girls up the same as other Christians, but this

does not mean they forsake all the former principles and

customs of their native country, adopting American and

European methods exclusively. On the contrary, they merely

adopt the Christian principles and leave the good Japanese

customs just as they are. The little Japanese Christian girl

is taught how to pray, how to sing, and how to act as a

Christian girl ought. Where the parents are not Christians,

the little girl is taken to the temple occasionally, but she

is entirely free in her belief.</p>
            <p>

     It is not customary in Japan to give girls special

allowances of money. When the parents are rich, they

naturally give them plenty, and where poor the opposite is

the case, but there is no custom nor rule about this.

However, there are a great many girls in Japan who earn

their own livings in different ways, and are to a certain

extent free from parental restraint and independent. Many

girls are now engaged in the post-offices, government

telegraph and telephone offices, and as teachers in the

primary schools and kindergartens. Many of them also are

trained nurses in the hospitals.</p>
            <p>

     And there are the geishas (dancing girls), who are

found in all large Japanese cities. The geisha first came

into evidence about the middle of the last century, and in a

short time her popularity was such that her presence became

indispensable at parties, which, but for her contagious

vivacity and mirth, would perhaps have been flat and

insipid. Her duties are not merely to serve tea, and dance

for the entertainment of her patrons, but she is expected to

laugh and talk gayly, even if on the most trivial subjects.

A geisha must be highly accomplished in many ways. She plays

the samisen and often a number of other musical instruments,

dances, sings, and talks, and her remuneration is generally

large.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>Japanese parents take great pride in dressing their

daughters nicely and cleanly, and have them behave like

little ladies. The long and wide sleeves, which reach clear

down to the knees, and the long sash, or obi (generally

fifteen feet long and fourteen inches wide), and the long

kimono are the peculiar points of the Japanese dress. The

common dress is made of cotton, and is only worn by the poor

people. The silk dress is usually worn by the well-to-do

people. There is a great variety in the price of a silk

dress. Though silk is so cheap in Japan, a good obi or sash

(not the best) very often costs one hundred dollars, but, of

course, this lasts its wearer many years, frequently a

lifetime. The average expenditure for a girl's dress is

about three hundred yen, which is the equivalent of about

three hundred silver dollars.</p>
            <p>

     When the Japanese girl is about fifteen or sixteen

years of age she gains her first knowledge of
“society.” She

may spend evenings playing “Karutta,” a noble indoor
game,

which resembles the English game of “Authors”; she may
go to

the seaside and to the mountains in summer time with the

young boys, and thus have a chance to enjoy the society of

her friends. She may also get into good society during her

latter schooldays. However, the friendships are never

carried to any great extent in her girlhood days. The

average age for marrying is about fifteen to twenty for

girls and twenty to thirty for boys.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>There exists in Japan, among some of the classes, a

certain custom of hiring a midwoman, nakoda, or professional

matchmaker, in order to make an engagement between a couple.

It often happens that a family will desire an alliance with

another family with whom they are not intimately acquainted.

Then are the services of the professional matchmaker

invaluable. To be successful in such a profession one must

never be known as such to the family she desires to court.

Very often nakodas and midwomen follow this profession for

years and yet are not known as such save to those who have

employed them.</p>
            <p>

     Most of the matchmakers are very honest, and it is

their duty to discover all the good and bad points of the

couple and point them out to the parents; they give good

advice, and do everything possible to promote the happiness

of the pair. They travel back and forth to the homes of the

young people, who are entirely ignorant of their motive,

carrying compliments and presents, and trying in a delicate

manner to work on their sentiment.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>After finding a suitable youth, the courtship begins

under the guidance of the parents. If the girl's parents are

very strict in obeying the ancient rules and ways, they will

never permit her to be, even for a moment, with a boy they

do not themselves approve of, and even if they do like him

she is not allowed to be with him alone until they are

married. Many of the parents in Japan, however, believe in

courtship between the young people, and permit their

children to have as much license as is given children in any

country.</p>
            <p>

     Marriage is usually preceded by a ceremonious

betrothal, which is more binding than the “engagements”
of

Western countries. The engagement is usually short in Japan.

Sometimes, however, the boy is a regular soldier, who cannot

form a family until after his discharge from the army, or,

again, he may be a student in a foreign country. Then the

engagement is very long (sometimes more than three years).

When an engagement takes place, the boy and girl exchange

matrimonial presents, the boy giving the girl an obi and the

latter giving him the hakama, or man's silk skirt. Among the

poorer classes, the boy sometimes gives the girl a certain

amount of money (from fifty to one hundred yen) as a token

of engagement, and the date is fixed for the ceremony.</p>



                         <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>



            <p>When the girl is a Christian and the boy is not, she

generally lets him choose the form of marriage, though often

the ceremony is gone through in both ways to satisfy the

Christian. The ordinary ceremony would be rather

complicated, I think, to the idea of the American. Nowadays

bridal trips are in favor among the upper classes. Marriage

in Japan is only a civil contract, and not in any way a

religious one. It is protected by law and social

obligations. The church and state do not concern themselves

at all in marital affairs.</p>
            <p>

     The chief peculiarity about the ceremony is the

exchanging of cups of sake (a liquid) nine times: three

times the bride, three times the groom, three times the

midwoman who works between the pair in making the

engagement. Toward the end of the ceremony a singer sings a

song called “Takasago,” which narrates the loving and
happy

life of an old couple. Thus the ceremony closes, the last

notes of the singer's beautiful melody remaining in the air,

charming all. The last stage of girl life is over.</p>
