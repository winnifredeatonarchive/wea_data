By Onoto Watanna</head>

            <p>All afternoon she had pored over the story. Now, as she
closed the book, her face still held its absorbed expression
of pain. Her cheek-bones were flushed, her eyes snapped
feverishly. She looked as if she wanted to express her
thoughts violently to somebody.</p>
            <p>
     Somebody, as it happened, just then opened the door,
after a light tap, and thrust in a bright, laughing face.</p>
            <p>“Still reading, ladykins?”</p>
            <p>
     “No, I have finished the story. I will say, it—affects
me horribly!”</p>
            <p>
     The girl, a pretty young thing of twenty, moved her fan
vigorously. It was hot, and she would much have preferred
being out somewhere, pulled along in a jinrikisha<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> through
the fascinating streets and parks. But she herself had lent
the book to her prospective mother-in-law.</p>
            <p>“It is a dear tale,” she admitted good-humoredly.</p>
            <p>
     “Dear!” repeated the elder lady. “It is a bit of life—
tragedy—here in Japan! I feel it—know it must have
happened scores of times.”</p>
            <p>
     She turned somewhat irritably toward the maid who had
silently entered the room and as silently had thrust a tray
before her.</p>
            <p>
     “No, thank you.” Then to Gertrude: “This is the fourth
time this afternoon they have sent up the tray. I've already
said no. Kiku is so officious that if she did not happen to
be the only maid here who speaks English, I believe I———
What are you waiting for?”</p>
            <p>
     Kiku smiled, that ever ready, mysterious smile, half
humility, half as though she laughed within herself. She was
a diminutive, brown-faced city wench, who, so the Howlands
had learned, had once been a geisha. In some way or other
she had acquired a certain knowledge of the English
language, and as she was really an excellent servant in
spite of the suspicion of superciliousness about her, she
was in great demand about the hotel.</p>
            <p>
     “Aexcuse”—now bowed the smiling Kiku—“bud mos' humble
one got frien'—mek a nize call unto Okusama. She mek a beg
look

<pb n="685"/>

at mos' august magnificent wedding clothes of elevated
foreign young miss.”</p>
            <p>“Not at present.” Mrs. Howland shook her head.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, do let them,” interposed Gertrude sweetly. “You
know we should be just as interested in a Japanese bride's
trousseau, and———”</p>
            <p>
     “Very well, then. Kiku-san, you may take your friend
into Miss Gertrude's room, but be very careful to touch
nothing.”</p>
            <p>
     For a while Gertrude, at least, listened to the
tittering and whispering on the other side the partition,
which was very fragile. Mrs. Howland, however, soon called
for her full attention.</p>
            <p>
     “Do you know what I think of these Japanese marriages?”
she demanded—“the ones between foreigners and native
girls?”</p>
            <p>“No; what do you think, dear?”</p>
            <p>
     “I declare that they are just as binding as any other
kind of marriage.”</p>
            <p>
     She arose and stood looking fiercely at the inoffensive
Gertrude.</p>
            <p>
     “If a son of mine contracted any such union,” said she,
“I should force him to bring his Japanese wife to me, and I
should protect her, if necessary, from him.”</p>
            <p>
     The murmuring in the adjoining room had ceased, and
from the two peep-holes, quite plainly shown on the wall, it
was clear that the Japanese girls were attracted by the
Okusama's deep and commanding voice.</p>
            <p>
     “Here,” she went on oracularly, “we have before us the
candid, tragic tale of a girl victim of some brute
countryman of our own.”</p>
            <p>“But it is only a tale!”</p>
            <p>
     “The man who wrote it knew,” declared the older woman
vehemently.</p>
            <p>
     “The man who wrote it lived all his life in
Philadelphia,” laughed the girl.<ref target="n2">[2]</ref>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. Howland regarded the girl severely.</p>
            <p>
     “My dear Gertrude,” she said coldly, “It is immaterial
where the author lived. The fact remains that such things
happen daily in Japan. It is a well known thing.”</p>
            <p>
     Gertrude turned away, sighing slightly, and, leaning
from the window, she stared wistfully up the street.</p>
            <p>“I wonder where Noble is,” she said softly.</p>
            <p>
     “Why, in Yokohama, of course. He must finish that
contract, you know.”</p>
            <p>
     “Yes, I do know; but I just wondered—for the moment—
where he was, and what he was doing.”</p>
            <p>She arose languidly, most of her bright look gone.</p>
            <p>
     “I'm going for a little ride, dear. Good-bye for the
present.”</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland, alone, continued to regard the book
fixedly. She

<pb n="686"/>

was a woman of turbulent emotions and commanding nature.
Though outwardly big and almost mannish, her expression
concealed a heart of such extraordinary charity that her
very indignation over the wrongs of others fixed her
features harshly.</p>
            <p>
     Twilight was settling, and the smoothly matted chamber,
with its bamboo chairs and furnishings—a concession to
foreign guests—was becoming quite dark. The lady with the
book became aware of this. She set it down and crossed the
room to ring for lights, absently surprised that Kiku had
not come sooner to perform this service. A photograph of her
son, insecurely tacked upon the wall, served to distract her
attention. There was a glint of light across the face, which
smiled out at his mother in an engaging, boyish fashion. She
looked at it steadily, the severity of her face slowly
softening away.</p>
            <p>
     “My boy!” she said gently; and then: “Thank God he is
different!”</p>
            <p>
     As she opened the door she nearly walked into the
little figure pressed up there against it, her head drooped
downward, the face hidden in the long, loose sleeve of her
kimona. Mrs. Howland started back with an ejaculation of
astonishment. For a moment she remained staring at the
little figure before her. Then, her hand trembling slightly,
she touched the girl's arm.</p>
            <p>“You are in trouble. What can I do for you?”</p>
            <p>
     The hump upon the girl's back suddenly moved upward,
showing a baby's small, round head. A little gurgling sound,
a soft chuckle of baby joy, was the only answer she
received. Mrs. Howland's heart beat with a great mothering
thud. At the same time, the maid, Okiku-san, in her
noiseless stockinged feet, pattered into the apartment and
one by one lit the lamps. Her face with its perpetual smile
seemed more mask-like than ever, and as she went from the
room her narrow slits of eyes seemed barely to rest upon the
visitor now slowly raising her head. The face Mrs. Howland
found herself looking into was like one she had dreamed of
or imagined. It was pretty, after a doll-like, babyish
fashion. The cheeks were round and rosy, and the eyes,
palpably meant for mirth and laughter, were full of a
child's appeal. Now Mrs. Howland placed her. She was exactly
like the heroine of the story, even to her poppy-crowned
head and rosy kimona.</p>
            <p>“What is it, dear? Can you speak English?”</p>
            <p>“Yaes, honorable one.”</p>
            <p>“What can I do for you?”</p>
            <p>Two little hands were instantly extended to her.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, mos' high up one, pity me!” said the girl
tremulously. “I—I got a breagin' ad my heart!” and she
clutched her heart tightly.</p>
            <p>“You poor little creature! Tell me your trouble.”</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="687"/>

     “My hosban'—he 'Merican-jin. Me? I loogin' aeverywhere
for him. Marry me jost liddle bit while. Me? I no god
moaneys account he goin' way. Baby velly much starve. Mos'
sad.”</p>
            <p>
     Every fibre in Mrs. Howland was now athrill. So here
before her was one of the very victims of which she had
heard and read. So full indeed was her heart that she could
not find words to express herself, a condition in the lady
almost unbelievable. Her feelings, however, were destined to
a new laceration and shock, for the girl went on, her words
gathering headlong speed with the earnestness and pain which
apparently possessed her:</p>
            <p>
     “So—me?” I comin' unto you. Hear you mos' kind lady ad
Japan. I come beggin' thad you speak unto your son. Ask him
condescend show liddle kindness unto me—thas hees wife, and
also thas hees bebby!”</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland's face was like a gray, paralyzed mask.
She could not move. She could not speak. Her boy! She stared
fixedly, glaringly, at the girl, who had again thrown out a
pair of exquisite little hands. Her tremulous voice seemed
overfreighted with tears.</p>
            <p>
     “I—I loave you' son,” she breathed, “and liddle while
ago also he loavin' me. Oh, pray you be nod harsh unto me.
For myself I ask nothing, bud for my bebby—for hees bebby—
I cum unto you. Ah, pray you, tek thad liddle bebby! Wiz me
he starve. I go away, bag unto my fadder's house, worg lik'
slave, mek enough eat!”</p>
            <p>
     The handle of the door turned, but ere it opened Mrs.
Howland was pressed against it.</p>
            <p>“Gertrude, go away!” Her voice was hoarse, terrible.</p>
            <p>
     “What is it, dear?” outside cried the girl. “Please let
me in.”</p>
            <p>“No. Go away!”</p>
            <p>“Something is wrong. Let me in. I will. . . . Oh-h!”</p>
            <p>
     Her young strength was greater than that of the older
woman, and she forced her way in. Her face was still white
with the unknown fear she had experienced when the other
woman had held her out. Nor did the color come back to it as
she looked from the intruder to Mrs. Howland. The older
woman was speechless. She had covered her face with a pair
of trembling hands and had sunk down limply into the nearest
chair. The baby on the girl's back tossed itself upward and
waved its small fat fists triumphantly.</p>
            <p>Suddenly Mrs. Howland leaped frantically to her feet.</p>
            <p>
     “Let me look at it!” she cried hoarsely, and seized
upon the baby. Her eyes widened with horrified emotion as
she saw the color of its hair and eyes, the one tawny red,
as was her own son's, the other blue as the sea, as were her
son's.</p>
            <p>
     “Dear Mrs. Howland, for pity's sake tell me what does
it mean? Why are you so agitated? Who is this girl?”</p>

            <pb n="688"/>

            <p>“My poor, poor child!” said Mrs. Howland hoarsely. “My
heart bleeds for you. But”—and she turned heroically toward
the Japanese girl, whose face was again hidden in her
sheltering sleeve—“but right is right. We as women, as
sisters to this poor, betrayed creature, owe her a duty and-
-reparation! What my son refused to give her, I will—
protection!”</p>
            <p>“Mrs Howland—”</p>
            <p>
     “Gertrude, it is better you should know the truth, and
you must try to bear it like a woman—a brave and noble
woman. This girl is my son Noble's wife, and this—his
child!”</p>
            <p>
     Gertrude stared at her with an expression almost of
hatred, so intense was her horror of the woman's statement.
Then with only a lowly whispered “Oh-h!” she slipped
forward, fainting for the first time in all her strong young
life.</p>
            <p>

     Mr. John Noble Howland, Jr., was inditing a love
letter. He sat in his pleasant office—he was an architect
of Yokohama, catering chiefly to the foreign residents who
had their bungalows on the cliffs—before a long table, upon
which various maps and papers were laid, apparently in
excellent order. Having covered fifteen pages with closely
written terms of endearment, he coolly proceeded to end the
letter with a series of circular marks. Apparently they had
some occult meaning comprehensible only to the one who
should receive the epistle, for presently he chuckled, and
then, with an impulsive, boyish movement, stooped and put
his lips upon the aforesaid circles.</p>
            <p>
     He had barely sealed the letter when his secretary
brought him a telegram, and acquainted him for the sixth
time with the information of the waiting clients without.</p>
            <p>
     “In a minute,” said the American cheerily, opening and
smoothing out the telegram. “What the——— Well, what's the
matter with old mater now!”</p>
            <p>The telegram he held read as follows:</p>

            <q>Come at once to your wife and baby with me. God
     forgive. Gertrude cannot.</q>

            <p>He re-read the telegram with deepening amazement, then,
swinging about in his chair—</p>
            <p>
     “Hi, Taku! Mistake here. Somebody else's wire,” and he
gave the paper back to the secretary.</p>
            <p>
     But as he turned over the letter he had just written to
Miss Anderson, the words of the telegram kept sticking in
his mind: “God forgive. Gertrude cannot.”</p>
            <p>
     He ran his hand nervously through his curly crop of
auburn hair.</p>
            <p>
     “Strange!” he said. “If it wasn't for that confounded
contract,

<pb n="689"/>

I'd light out for Tokyo. Just like mother to insist upon
settling there, with me stationed here. Poor little girl,
coming all the way here to marry a homely duffer like me—
and here I am cooped up with——— What is it now, Taku?
Another telegram?”</p>
            <p>
     He slipped his finger under the flap and opened the
envelope. He turned pale as he read. Then a slow flush
darkened his face, flooding his neck, too. He had the
outraged, indignant look so often worn by his mother.
Muttering an oath, he picked up his hat, slammed it down
upon his head, and fairly rushed out of his office, passing
the waiting clients without a word. The telegram this time
had been very plain:</p>

            <q>Leave for U.S. at once. Return all gifts to you.
     Never want to see your face again. —G. Anderson.</q>

            <p>Meanwhile another individual had received an equally
confounding wire. He was having the time of his life. Away
from all home dissenting or opposition, Mr. John Noble
Howland, Sr., was enjoying a little fishing trip in
secluded, peaceful Sendai. He was a little man, with a
wizened, anxious face, which nevertheless showed a hint of
an abundant sense of humor. His brows puckered comically as
with adjusted glasses he read the following message:</p>

            <q>Come at once. Noble has wife and baby. Gertrude
     leaves for U.S. at once. —Ellen.</q>

            <p>“Dear me!” said the little old gentleman, scratching
the back of his ear. But he fished all of that morning and
most of the afternoon ere he answered the telegram:</p>

            <q>Bless and forgive young people impetuous action.
     Will return soon as possible.</q>

            <p>The answer to this came at night, when he was awakened
from a most delightful slumber:</p>

            <q>Gertrude not wife. Come at once.</q>

            <p>This looked more serious, and the old gentleman's face
was stern as he prepared to start for Tokyo.</p>
            <p>

     Attired in an orange-colored kimona, decorated with
silver storks and reeds, the red-haired baby looked
incongruous and fascinating. His eyes were the brightest
blue, his skin as white as milk, save where the cheeks
expanded on either side into two rosy red balloons. He was a
noisy little chap, given to loud and engaging laughter.
Unwelcome perhaps he may have been upon his arrival, but by
constant and

<pb n="690"/>

persistent degrees he had laughed and chuckled his way into
the hearts of even the stoniest disposed toward him.</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland had accepted him as a matter of duty, and
not, as she sternly assured Gertrude, from any motive of
affection. Before retiring, however, she had not resisted
the impulse which induced her to go to the impromptu bed
prepared for the little stranger. There he lay in a rosy
sleep, his fat legs outside the covers. His hair was one
mass of ringlets; one fat thumb was snugly tucked into the
diminutive mouth. Mrs. Howland turned away quickly, the
choking feeling in her throat and the new fluttering at her
heart causing her to look even more severe, as though she
fiercely sought to fight against impending tears.</p>
            <p>
     Twice in the night she stole out of bed to reassure
herself that he was covered up—the nights were chilly—and
almost before the dawn the lady was panically answering the
first demands of the morning. He was howling like a good
fellow for his milk. She aroused Kiku and sent her flying in
search of milk or baby's food, and meanwhile she walked the
floor with the rampant infant clutched warmly and closely to
her now thoroughly thawed-out heart.</p>
            <p>
     “After all,” she apologized to herself, “he's mine—my
very own little grandchild. I understand my feelings now.
It's nature! There, there, there, lovey, in a minute, in a
minute. Milky comin' in a minute!”</p>
            <p>
     Duly fed and changed, master baby resumed his customary
humor, and, to the amazed delight of his now doting
grandmother, ejaculated these two clearly spoken American
words: “Da-da!” and “Mum-mum!”</p>
            <p>
     “To think,” said Mrs. Howland, “that the poor creature
actually taught her baby to speak its father's language!”</p>
            <p>
     This feat of the baby's was too much for her to keep to
herself, and she obeyed the fond impulse to confide in
Gertrude. In her now overwhelming infatuation for the baby,
she had almost forgotten the condition of the girl. She was
quickly recalled to this, however, as soon as she entered
Gertrude's room. The young girl's face looked pinched and
faded. There were peevish lines of pain about her mouth. Her
eyes were dark and wild-looking. She turned a bitter,
reproachful look upon the elder woman.</p>
            <p>“My poor, poor———”</p>
            <p>
     “No, you need not pity me. Besides, you don't really
feel it!”</p>
            <p>“My poor child!”</p>
            <p>
     “I know all about it. I saw you with—with that———
My feelings are nothing to you—my future—the humiliation I
shall have to bear—the—the——— Oh-h! to think of my
coming out here—leaving my home. Papa knew. Papa guessed.
That's why he insisted that we

<pb n="691"/>

wait. That's why he imposed the condition on Noble that he
should go away and do something—achieve something. He has.
He has. A hideous little heathen imp!”</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland's face had undergone various changes of
expression. First anxiety, melting pity, then outraged
pride, indignation. She was standing as severely and sternly
now as a statue.</p>
            <p>“You apply that term to my grandchild?”</p>
            <p>
     “Yes, yes—your grandchild! Ha, ha! It's a joke—
screechingly funny. It would be if it—if it—weren't so
terrible! I shall be a laughing-stock. Oh!—I! Think of it!
And you talk of your grandchild! You are all wrapped up in
it. You think of it, not me. You flame into anger against me—me—who———”</p>
            <p>
     “No, no, dear child:” and she knelt beside the girl and
attempted to draw her to her, but Gertrude pushed her away,
her little hands fairly hurting as she shoved Mrs. Howland
aside and stood up.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, let me be! Go away—do! You're just like he is—
just like your son. I never realized before how much.”</p>
            <p>
     “Gertrude!” Mrs. Howland's voice broke. “You know I
love you. Yet out of suffering must come strength. Let us
not visit our wrath upon the innocent.”</p>
            <p>
     Gertrude began pushing back the loose hair from her
face, and searching about the little bamboo stand for her
brush.</p>
            <p>
     “Come with me,” pleaded the older woman, “and see for
yourself—the little baby! I am sure it will soften your
heart.”</p>
            <p>
     “I don't like babies,” said the girl peevishly. She was
brushing her hair now with a feverish little hand. “Besides,
I've no time. I'm going to catch that steamer, if possible.
I'm going to see about my ticket, and—go—home. I hate
Japan! It's a horrid, detestable place, and the people look
like—like monkeys.” She set her hair in place with a final
vicious twist.</p>
            <p>“Okusama———” Kiku was bowing in the doorway.</p>
            <p>“What is it?”</p>
            <p>“Honorable baby-san jus' receive bath.”</p>
            <p>
     A bitter, sneering smile had curled up the lips of the
girl at the unconscious look of maternity which had softened
the entire face of Mrs. Howland.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, go, go!” cried she banteringly, pushing her along.
“Yum-yum wants you. There! I'll go with you, too!” and she
flung out of the room recklessly, pushing the older woman
along.</p>
            <p>
     Upon a woollen blanket which had been spread upon the
matted floor, before a warm hibachi, the little baby lay. He
was upon his back, both fat little legs in the air, the foot
of one gleefully enclasped in a round, dimpled hand. He was
in a frenzy of delight, induced by his erstwhile successful
efforts to sit up halfway and also his

<pb n="692"/>

ability to put his toe into his mouth. His mirth appeared to
increase at the approach of the new-comers, and, as if to
perform for their especial benefit, he rolled over on his
stomach and endeavored to raise himself to his knees by
pressing his two little hands upon the floor. Then he rolled
over on his back again. He lay still for a moment, suddenly
sobered. His eyes, going from the admiring nurse to the
emotion-choked grandmother, had finally fallen upon the
pale, working face of Miss Gertrude Anderson. A smile which
opened up his rosy mouth, showing the four ridiculous little
teeth within, and displaying every adorable dimple encrusted
in his fair fatness, was directed fully at the girl.</p>
            <p>
     “He is sweet!” she whispered in a strangled voice, and
suddenly she slipped to her knees, and, with her face hidden
on its warm little body, she burst into a passion of tears.</p>
            <p>

     John Noble Howland, Jr., burst open the door of his
mother's sitting-room. She looked up from her fascinating
employment to see him glowering there in the doorway.
Setting the baby down, she arose and faced him. At the same
moment Gertrude came into the room from an interior
apartment. Her face looked lily white and ethereal. It was
to her impulsively he turned. Something in the girl's face
went to his heart. He forgot the bitterness of thought he
had been enduring. He knew only that Gertrude, the girl he
loved, was suffering.</p>
            <p>“Gertrude!”</p>
            <p>
     She drew herself up. Her eyes met his squarely. They
whipped him with their icy contempt. She condescended not
one word. He turned to his mother. His voice was husky,
stupid. What is it, mater?”</p>
            <p>
     “You—know!” she said solemnly. “It is useless to waste
words.”</p>
            <p>
     He had recovered from the shock of the change in his
fiancée. His temper was aroused again.</p>
            <p>
     “Know! I know nothing. What sort of ruction is this
you've got up anyhow?”</p>
            <p>“Noble Howland, I am your mother, but—”</p>
            <p>
     “See here, I want to get at facts. What's the matter
with you? What've I done that I should suddenly get such
damnable messages from you both, and now this sweet
reception?”</p>
            <p>
     “What have you done?” repeated his outraged mother.
“Wretch! That I should have to so call my own son! Yet,
understand, no matter what your father may say, no matter
what you yourself may say, I intend to stand by your wife
and child!”</p>
            <p>“My wife and———! Say, is it a joke? What the———”</p>
            <p>
     “I would that it were,” groaned his mother, “but, alas!
it is only

<pb n="693"/>

too true. Your Japanese wife has been here. We know all.
What is more, we have—taken—your child.”</p>
            <p>
     “My——— Well, if this doesn't beat the Dutch. Say,
I'd laugh if I wasn't so ——— tired.”</p>
            <p>
     Here his mother impressively raised the kimono-clad
infant and held it out toward him. He stared at it with his
mouth agape.</p>
            <p>
     “That brat—mine!” he suddenly exploded. “Not by a
darned sight! You're crazy—loony—bug-house—dopey!”</p>
            <p>
     As he spoke, he repelled the advances of the friendly
infant with a savage push of the hand. His action had an
instant effect upon both ladies. It was strange that he did
not wither under the lightning looks of scorn and
indignation cast upon him. Gertrude, without a word, had
stepped between him and the baby, as if to shield it from
pollution even by sight of its unwilling parent. Seizing it
in her arms, she cuddled it up against her neck, murmuring
words of pity and endearment.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Howland faced her son.</p>
            <p>
     “If,” said she, “you, my son, are base enough to deny
your own son, then I deny—denounce you!”</p>
            <p>
     “Deny it!” shouted the now thoroughly enraged Noble.
“It's a ——— impostor<ref target="n3">[3]</ref>. Look at the brat. Does it resemble
me?”</p>
            <p>
     Gertrude coldly turned toward him, holding the baby
slightly forward. Her action was even more eloquent than his
mother's words.</p>
            <p>
     “Unfortunately for it,” said Mrs. Howland, “it has
inherited none of its poor mother's racial characteristics.
From the top of its little red head to its tiny pink heels,
with a mole upon each, as I, your mother, can testify is
upon your own, he is the living image of you as you were
when a baby.”</p>
            <p>
     “Rot!” shrilly cried the young man, lunging savagely
across the room. “All red-haired kids look alike, and
everybody has moles on their heels.” He went into the next
room, slamming the door so loudly behind him that it seemed
as if the whole hotel were shaken.</p>
            <p>

     Meanwhile, Howland, senior, was speeding along through
the intricate streets of Tokyo in a little jerking vehicle
propelled by manpower. He had been travelling all night, and
now, dusty, sleepy, and tired, he listened with only half
interest to the monotonous shouting of some vender, or
jinrikiman, as he took him to be. The man had a gigantic
sign, a square-faced lantern, upon which black letters were
printed. This was carried aloft upon a stick. Whatever the
message or advertisement, it was printed on the four sides
of the lantern. As he drew nearer to the jinrikisha of Mr.
Howland the latter saw that half of the lettering was in
English. He leaned slightly out of his carriage and read:</p>

            <pb n="694"/>

             <q>lost or stolen! baby taken from——</q>

            <p>The man whirled the sign about on his stick, and when
next it was visible to the now more distant rider he could
see only the illumined lettering of the name of the European
hotel where his own family were stopping. The incident
troubled him, for he was of a tender-hearted disposition;
besides, foreigners in Japan really have a brotherly feeling
at bottom for one another. He jogged in discomfort along.</p>
            <p>
     As they drew up before the hotel, Mr. Howland noticed
that the rooms occupied by his family appeared to be all
lighted, even his son's. Apparently they were still up,
though it was past midnight. Noble must be in Tokyo—the
scamp!</p>
            <p>
     He knocked before entering his wife's sitting-room, and
some one within hastily opened the door. There in various
rigid attitudes of antagonism were his wife, his son, and
Gertrude. The latter was smiling slightly, but in a
contemptuous, baffling way. Noble had his head thrown
defiantly back, his hands thrust in his trousers pockets. He
seemed to have just come from the adjoining room, for the
door was still half-opened behind him.</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland, strong, self-reliant lady, let forth a
cry at the advent of her husband, and flew at once to his
sheltering arms.</p>
            <p>“Oh, John, John, John! You are here at last!”</p>
            <p>
     He found himself patting her as if she were a child.
She had clutched hold of him as if he were some rock of
salvation which would save them from all further peril. He
turned inquiringly first toward his son and then toward
Gertrude. She spoke with a bitter brightness:</p>
            <p>
     “You've interrupted a most touching domestic incident,
Mr. Howland.”</p>
            <p>“Yes?”</p>
            <p>
     “Your wife just opened the door of—er—the baby's
room, to find—to find its papa cuddling and playing with
it. Quite natural, of course, and very pretty, I'm sure.”</p>
            <p>
     “Isn't it?” snarled Noble, who looked like a great,
sulky, angry boy. “I did pick up the little cub. Went in to
take a look at it. It was friendly disposed at first, then
started to howl. So I dangled it to hush its cries. I always
did like kids!” he added defiantly.</p>
            <p>
     “Especially when they're your own,” said Gertrude, with
sarcastic sweetness.</p>
            <p>
     “Dad”—he turned to his father—“you don't believe it
of me, do you? Why, I—I've lived the straightest sort of
life here. I've never even looked cross-eyed at a Japanese
girl, and as for marrying one and having a———” He choked.</p>
            <p>
     His father coughed uneasily, his brows drawing together
in a frown that was half humorous and half severe.</p>

            <pb n="695"/>

            <p>“The facts are these,” put in his wife ponderously: “a
Japanese girl claims to be the wife of your son. She says
they were married about a year ago. He, like other
foreigners who contract these abominable unions, considered
it but temporary, and accordingly deserted her and her
child. On account of dear Gertrude here, I insisted upon his
wife's returning to her own people, for the present at
least, which she was eager indeed to do. I gave her ample
money to defray all expenses. To me the case is a most
tragic one, but for one illuminating item. Oh, John, the
baby—our own grandchild, John—is—beautiful!—and the
living image of Noble!”</p>
            <p>
     “Pish!” snorted the young man, disgusted. “If I thought
I looked anything like that red-faced, bloated, animated
atom, I'd go swallow myself whole.”</p>
            <p>
     “That is one thing,” said Mrs. Howland explosively, “I
will not endure. One word of criticism or derision of that
innocent child, your own flesh and blood!”</p>
            <p>Howland, senior, interposed timidly.</p>
            <p>
     “Suppose we all go to bed and sleep upon the matter.
Perhaps,” he added with a weak attempt to be jocular, “it's
nothing but a bad dream, after all.”</p>
            <p>

     The Howland family occupied a suite of four rooms
running one after the other down the full length of the
hotel corridor. The first of these rooms was Gertrude's.
Then came the sitting-room, which opened into Mrs. Howland's
room, and, finally, at the end of the hall, was the room
always reserved for Noble.</p>
            <p>
     On this night the head of the family, tired and
badgered, and ardently desiring a long, silent night of
peaceful rest, wisely opined that there was no prospect of
this if his room was to be shared by an uncertain infant.
Accordingly he timidly suggested to his wife that the baby
sleep in the sitting-room. She spurned the very thought of
such a thing. The idea! Never had she seen such an
extraordinarily good baby before. Why, it slept clear
through from its ten o'clock bottle till a little before
five. Mr. Howland blinked at the thought of that five
o'clock awakening. That blink was fatal. Instantly his wife
pounced upon it. Her words belied her injured tone.</p>
            <p>
     “While I, his grandmother, would not think of leaving
him in a room by himself, there is really no occasion, John,
for you to sacrifice your own comfort. There's an unoccupied
room, I believe, in the very next corridor. Go down to the
office at once and secure it.”</p>
            <p>
     “I will,” said her husband unflinchingly, and,
whistling with gay bravado, he obeyed his wife's injunction.</p>
            <p>
     It was a nice, square room, the last but one at the end
of the long hall. The big enamelled bed looked inviting to
the tired one, as he

<pb n="696"/>

proceeded to pull off his boots. So sleepy was he that his
head was nodding even while he buttoned his pajamas, and as
his head finally touched the pillow a deep breath that was
in itself a gentle snore escaped him.</p>
            <p>
     The clock pointed to 1:45 a.m., an hour when reasonable
night-quiet might be expected even in a Japanese hotel. At
1:55 he suddenly sat up in bed with a start. In the darkness
he remained sitting, with his ears pricked up. He struck a
match, looked under his bed. Then he lay down again.</p>
            <p>
     Two minutes later he again sat up, his queer little
face thrust out alertly. Plainly in the silence and darkness
he heard the low moaning and sobbing of a woman in distress
or pain. So weirdly did the sound at first strike him that
he imagined it ghostly, and could not stir. A fit of
shivering seized him. The perspiration dripped down his
face. He managed to get out of bed, fumbled around, found
his clothes and matches, and lit the lamp.</p>
            <p>
     Presently he heard the sound of some one in the
adjoining room—it was the one at the end of the hall—
tramping heavily across the floor, and the low wailing grew
louder, wilder. Then suddenly it was muffled, and a man's
voice sounded gruffly above the moaning. Whatever he was
saying or doing appeared to arouse the sufferer to a sudden
wild activity the next moment. The trembling old man in the
next room could hear her as she sprang to her feet and
plunged in some headlong rush across the room. He heard them
struggling within, and, trembling as if afflicted with ague,
Mr. Howland crept to the bell and pushed it.</p>
            <p>
     Presently it was silent again in the adjoining room,
and he heard the man trampling heavily across the floor, as
though bearing some heavy load in his arms.</p>
            <p>
     No one answered Mr. Howland's summons. He thought of
opening his door and calling for help, arousing one of his
family. How ardently he wished he had remained with his wife
this night! But he was in a condition of real terror. Here
in a strange “heathen” country he was conscious of the
possibility of unknown crimes.</p>
            <p>
     By and by he crept back into bed again, but, even with
his head under the covers, all through the night he heard
the woman crying and the dull steady walking of the man, as
if on guard, back and forth, back and forth, until the dawn.</p>
            <p>

     Noble Howland was sleeping the sound, dreamless sleep
of healthy, guiltless youth. He too was tired out. He had
spent an entire day and a good part of a night trying to
induce two “cracked” women to see that it was impossible for
him to belie his name—Noble. On the one hand he met the
outraged, indignant regard of his mother, and on

<pb n="697"/>

the other the bitter, contemptuous, wild regard of the girl
he loved. He did love her—that was the beastly part of it,
he told himself. He loved her desperately and madly in spite
of her cruelty and delusions. When he retired he could not
efface from his mind her pale, scornful little face. It
tormented him. He seemed to see the tears and heartache
which showed like a shadow behind all her vaunted scorn and
indifference.</p>
            <p>
     He finally dropped off asleep, and slept unmoving until
the dawn. Then some one awoke him, and he turned over in bed
to hear his father's voice. Sleepy as he was, its tone
aroused him, and he stared up at the shaking, gray, haggard
little figure standing there by his bed in the dawn.</p>
            <p>“Dad!”</p>
            <p>
     He sprang up impetuously, throwing his arm about the
old man and drawing him down beside him.</p>
            <p>
     “Are you sick? Here, lie down. Get into my bed. Jove!
You're shivering. Hold on—I'll get you something.”</p>
            <p>
     He was out of bed in an instant. The old gentleman
swallowed the stimulant at a gulp.</p>
            <p>What was it, dad? Were you taken sick in the night?”</p>
            <p>
     The father shook his head, moistening his lips. Feebly
he told the boy the incidents of the night.</p>
            <p>
     “And they did not answer your ring? Well, I bet they
will mine,” he said, and stood with his finger steadily
pressed to the button until the hasty patter of feet along
the hall was heard and a very much disturbed little bell-boy
answered his summons.</p>
            <p>“Who occupies room 22—end of next corridor?”</p>
            <p>
     “Most elevated foreign gent and Mrs.,” glibly answered
the clerk.</p>
            <p>
     “Well, go to their room and find out what's the matter.
They've kept my father awake all night. There's something
wrong.”</p>
            <p>
     The Japanese boy agreed, bowing very politely and
solemnly.</p>
            <p>
     “Yaes, it unhappily is true, your graciousness. Poor
foreign Mrs. velly much wrong—velly ill. Got a—what you
call thad?—er—crack at a heart. Too bad. Velly sad.”</p>
            <p>“You mean she's in trouble of some sort?”</p>
            <p>
     “Yaes. Velly sad. Too bad. Velly sad. Velly sad. Nize
leddy! Pretty bebby, too—fine, fat! Got a hair like you
exaltedness.”</p>
            <p>
     The mystified look on Noble's face had slowly turned to
amazement.</p>
            <p>
     “You mean,” he queried eagerly, “that her trouble has
some connection with a baby?”</p>
            <p>
     He wondered vaguely as he put the question whether he
himself were going insane upon this baby subject. But the
Japanese boy bowed profoundly in assent.</p>
            <p>
     “Alas, thas fact, excellency. Velly bad nurse stealie
nize fat

<pb n="698"/>

bebby. Got a hair like you augustness. Foreign Mrs. speag a
scold at bad servant. Servant tek a bebby. Mek a nize walk
take. No come bag aeny more. Two—thlee—mebbe four day he
pass. No come. Velly sad. Velly sad. Too bad.”</p>
            <p>
     A wide, capacious grin slowly spread itself over the
countenance of Noble Howland, Jr. He turned to his father,
but that gentleman was snuggled up under the warm bed-
clothes and was sleeping at last, soundly and peacefully.</p>
            <p>
     “Hold on a bit,” said Noble, lowering his voice. Then
he scribbled hastily upon a pad of paper:</p>

            <q>Kindly call at Room 8, same floor, at ten a.m. to-
     day, concerning baby.</q>

            <p>He signed no name. With a chuckle, he handed the note
to the boy, at the same time slipping a coin into his hand.</p>
            <p>
     “Your job is to put that under the door of room 22,
sonny. Sabe?”</p>
            <p>

     It was fully two hours before ten o'clock that the
occupants of room No. 22 assailed the door of room No. 8. In
point of fact, they had rushed out the instant they had
found and read the note.</p>
            <p>
     Some one was singing inside room No. 8. It was a
woman's voice, very low and crooning, and she sang some
little nonsense song of a baby who sailed away on a lullaby
ship on a slumber sea, to return on a sunbeam with the day.
The woman outside the door knew the song too—had sung it
herself once upon a time—and now she clutched her husband's
arm, and sobbed against it in a way that was quite heart-
rending to see. The singer had stopped as their knock
sounded. Then she called, “Come!”</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland rose quickly as her visitors entered. She
had thought it was the late Kiku, who had again disappeared.
The woman, whose wan face looked as if it had been literally
washed out with tears, turned a pair of feverish eyes upon
her.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, we got your note! We couldn't wait. Please, oh,
please, please, tell me where is my baby!”</p>
            <p>
     “My note!” exclaimed Mrs. Howland. “There must be a
mistake. I wrote no note.”</p>
            <p>
     “Yes, yes, you did. Please don't say you did not. It
was about a baby—my baby. I—you see—we—we lost our
little, little baby.”</p>
            <p>
     A look of enlightenment and of intense pity dawned on
Mrs. Howland's face. The poor creature was demented. The
loss of her child had driven her mad. Oh, surely she, Mrs.
Howland, knew how to sympathize with such a suffering one,
and she knew a salve which might soothe even a heart as sore
as this poor mother's.</p>

            <pb n="699"/>

            <p>“Gertrude,” she called, “bring the baby, dear”; and
then, turning to the visitors: “We have a dear little
grandchild—a sweet little——— Madam!”</p>
            <p>
     The last word escaped her like an explosive. She saw
the eyes of the woman before her dilate wildly. Then, with a
cry that was like that of some entrapped animal suddenly set
free, she had darted forward. She tore the baby from the
arms of the panic-stricken Gertrude, and then in an agony of
bliss crushed it to her heart.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh-h!” said Gertrude, backing from her. “The poor
woman! What———”</p>
            <p>
     “Violent!” huskily whispered Mrs. Howland, turning for
confirmation to the man, who, strangely enough, had thrown
his arms bodily about the woman and child together.</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland essayed several times to attract their
attention, but vainly. She was wringing her hands and
saying: “My poor little grandchild! He will be hurt!”</p>
            <p>“Grandchild! That's good!”</p>
            <p>
     Her son, Noble, had suddenly appeared. His hands in his
pockets, he looked jeeringly down at the two women who
chiefly interested him.</p>
            <p>
     “Why, mamma, you old dotard, you, you don't mean to say
you are claiming kinship with these strange folk?”</p>
            <p>She turned on him sternly.</p>
            <p>“I will have none of your levity at this time.”</p>
            <p>“Ask them if you're the kid's grandma, then?”</p>
            <p>
     The man was looking at them now, his lean, grave face,
with the troubled, sleepless eyes, studying them slowly, as
though he dully speculated upon their exact relation to the
matter.</p>
            <p>
     “You wish to know whose child this is? Ours. Stolen
three days ago by a vicious nurse whom my wife was obliged
to reprimand. We later learned she was an adventuress, an ex-
geisha, who took positions with foreign families coming to
Japan, with the object of robbing them in some way. Last
night it was learned another conspirator assisted her, who
also acted as maid here—Okiku by name—perhaps you know
her? She has gone—probably got wind that we were on her
track. Her going prostrated my wife last night, as we had
thought Okiku might give us some clue. I feared my wife's
reason was giving way—that she would injure herself; but
now, you see—she—she—will be herself again!”</p>
            <p>
     Mrs. Howland sat down limply and stared dully at the
speaker.</p>
            <p>
     “How could she have known about us?” she said in a
hollow voice.</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, don't you remember?” put in Gertrude, with a voice
half vibrating with tears and half with a joy of which she
was fearful. “They were there that day, Okiku and her friend-
-in that next room.

<pb n="700"/>

Oh, they must have listened! And you said—you said you—you
would befriend and protect the Japanese wife of your son.
Don't you remember all you said that day?”</p>
            <p>Mrs. Howland did.</p>
            <p>
     “It's clear as day to me now,” said Gertrude. “We have
been deluded idiots—both of us!”</p>
            <p>“Exactly,” said Noble grimly.</p>
            <p>
     The man and the woman were going, the woman too
entranced even to turn to hear or heed the explanations.
Mrs. Howland choked as she watched them, and two great tears
rolled down her furrowed cheeks.</p>
            <p>
     “I—I—loved that baby,” she said. Then, after another
silence, she added slowly and painfully: “And I gave her
five hundred dollars. I could not conceive of a Japanese
adventuress. It seems incredible even now.”</p>
            <p>
     Her son mopped up her tears in a roughly affectionate
manner, half chiding, half loving.</p>
            <p>
     “And to think,” she added, gulping down a great sob,
“that I believed my own son capable of such villainy!”</p>
            <p>
     “Oh, you weren't the only one,” said he jauntily. “Now,
you take your punishment like a good fellow, mamma. Go in
there and blubber it out alone. I want to chastise
Gertrude.”</p>
            <p>
     After Mrs. Howland had gone the pair remained in a
silence which to one of them at least was hard to bear. She
was holding herself very stiffly, her proud little head
drooping not one jot from its height. She knew very well
that he was standing squarely in front of her, gloating over
her discomfiture. Finally she could bear it no longer.</p>
            <p>“Anyhow,” she said shakily, “its hair was red.”</p>
            <p>“A color you despise?” he questioned politely.</p>
            <p>
     For the first time she looked at him directly, and
instantly her face flamed.</p>
            <p>
     “I love it!” she said passionately. “It's your color—
dear!”</p>
            <p>
     She might have said more, but that her very close
proximity to her lover quite prevented.</p>
